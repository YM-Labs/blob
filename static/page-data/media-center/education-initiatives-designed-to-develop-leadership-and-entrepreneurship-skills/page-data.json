Through a series of unique programs that address key areas in education, WISE has grown in stature to help prepare students to become leaders within their communities. <br>\n <br>\n An initiative of Qatar Foundation under the leadership of its Chairperson Her Highness Sheikha Moza bin Nasser, WISE has demonstrated over the past few years how it has played a pivotal role in bringing together global thought leaders and educational practitioners with one aim of creating a better education environment for all.<br>\n <br>\n In recent years, WISE has established itself as a global reference in new approaches to education through a series of on-going initiatives, including the Learners&#x2019; Voice Program. Launched in 2010, it is designed to equip young people aged 18 to 25 with the relevant soft skills, tools, and know-how to address global education issues. In addition, it provides students with opportunities to explore barriers to education, and create innovative, yet realistic and achievable, solutions. <br>\n <img width=\"382\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%201-9.jpg\" alt=\"WISE: Developing Leadership and Entrepreneurship Skills\"><br>\n An integral part of the year-long Learners&#x2019; Voice Program is bringing together people from different backgrounds and cultures to tackle a universal issue, an element which proved popular among all the participants. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The Learners&#x2019; Voice Program has been a life-changing experience,&#x201D; said Khalid Al-Saegh, a Qatari student at Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar. His locally-targeted project, &#x2018;iSTEAM,&#x2019; aims to bring 3D printers to the classroom.<br>\n <br>\n Pakistani born Ahwaz Akhtar is a student at Georgetown University&#x2019;s School of Foreign Service in Qatar. His group&#x2019;s project, &#x2018;Orenda,&#x2019; is designed to help people who have been displaced from their homes due to natural disasters or war, specifically Afghans in Islamabad. <br>\n <img width=\"450\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Wise-Prize-for-Education-2013.jpg\" alt=\"Wise-Prize-for-Education-2013.jpg\"><br>\n This year, 34 young men and women were chosen from hundreds of promising applicants to take part in the 2014-2015 Learners&#x2019; Voice Program, launched at WISE 2014 with a series of workshops. The students had opportunities to meet with previous years&#x2019; participants to seek knowledge and advice, and share ideas. <br>\n <br>\n Now in its fifth year, the Learners&#x2019; Voice community comprises of over 100 Learners. The students are from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, from around the world. They share a passion for education, and together they represent a unique perspective within the WISE community.<br>\n <br>\n In addition to the Learners&#x2019; Voice, WISE aims to provide opportunities to individuals of all ages involved with established projects&#x2019; in an early stage of development. This year, the Summit served as the official launch of the WISE Accelerator, a tailor-made mentorship program to support high potential, scalable projects that address education challenges through innovative technology. <br>\n <br>\n In its inaugural year, five projects were selected to take part in the program, including &#x2018;Ustad Mobile.&#x2019; Based in the United Arab Emirates, Ustad Mobile is an application that enables educators to make their own mobile learning content, including audio, video, quizzes, and games. It is a learning platform that targets emerging or low-income countries. <br>\n <br>\n Among the other projects chosen for the inaugural WISE Accelerator were &#x2018;Ideas Box&#x2019; and &#x2018;Kytabu&#x2019;. Based in France, &#x2018;Ideas Box&#x2019; is a portable media center that provides an enhanced learning environment that can be adapted to any situation. &#x2018;Kytabu&#x2019;, created by a team in Kenya, is a mobile textbook subscription application on Android and Windows&#x200E; platforms that aims to provide students with access to affordable learning content.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/04-12-2014_WISE%20Learners&apos;%20Voice%20Programme_feature_En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf20","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/education-initiatives-designed-to-develop-leadership-and-entrepreneurship-skills","currSlug":"/media-center/education-initiatives-designed-to-develop-leadership-and-entrepreneurship-skills","title":"Education Initiatives Designed to Develop Leadership and Entrepreneurship Skills"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
