Not only this, but the best teachers are also respectful, friendly, and are enthusiastic about their subject and about teaching. That enthusiasm is very stimulating and engaging for students.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Simon explained that learners in clinical medicine settings can be categorized into four groups: reporters, who are adept at gathering data by taking a patient&#x2019;s history and conducting a physical exam; interpreters, who are good at assimilating that data and developing a differential diagnosis; managers, who can gather data, interpret it and also develop diagnostic and treatment plans; and educators, who can do all of these things while also teaching the concept to other learners. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Once you have categorized your learner, you can most effectively help them to progress by teaching to their level,&#x201D; he said.<br>\n <br>\n The lecture, titled Teaching Medicine: Adding Struts to the Goo, was accredited locally by the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners-Accreditation Department (QCHP-AD), and internationally by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME).<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180916%20English%20WCM-Q%20Grand%20Rounds%20discusses%20optimization%20of%20clinical%20tea....pdf\">here</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf1","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-grand-rounds-focus-on-clinical-teaching","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-grand-rounds-focus-on-clinical-teaching","title":"WCM-Q Grand Rounds Focus on Clinical Teaching"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
