Every Ashesi University College graduate has found quality employment, and almost all have remained in Africa, where many have started much-needed businesses. His innovation in higher education is not only empowering students; it also has the potential to transform Ghana and other African nations by developing a new generation of leaders and entrepreneurs.<br>\n <br>\n Awuah left Ghana in 1985 with $50 in his pocket and a full scholarship to Swarthmore College, in Pennsylvania, the United States. Over the next four years, its liberal arts education showed him the power of critical thinking, a stark contrast to his prior schooling. After graduating, he had a very successful career at Microsoft where he spearheaded design for dial-up Internet access. Keen to make a difference in his own country, he returned to Ghana, intending to start a software company.<br>\n <br>\n Arriving back in Ghana, Awuah quickly understood that fostering ethical leadership would be key to building a generation that is able to bring positive change in Africa. He decided to go back to study, this time to the University of California, Berkeley, to understand what it takes to start a university that would foster leadership and integrity.<br>\n <br>\n In 2002, Ashesi University College opened its doors in a rented house with a first class of 30 students. Today, Ashesi University College has a campus of 100 acres, overlooking Accra, with nearly 900 students. The college offers four-year bachelor degrees in engineering, business administration, computer science and management information systems. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_WISE%20Prize%20Press%20Release%20_En.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf65","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-prize-for-education-2017-presented-to-patrick-awuah","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-prize-for-education-2017-presented-to-patrick-awuah","title":"WISE Prize for Education 2017 Presented to Patrick Awuah"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
