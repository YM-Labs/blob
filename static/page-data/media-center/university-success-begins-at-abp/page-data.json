All ABP classes are conducted entirely in English, including Biology, Chemistry, and Physics labs as well as Algebra, Calculus, and computer skills courses.<br>\n <img width=\"341\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Abdulla%20Nasser%20Al-Thani_WCMCQ-17.jpg\" alt=\"Abdulla Nasser Al-Thani_WCMCQ.jpg\"><br>\n &#x201C;The ABP helped me improve my English speaking and writing skills,&#x201D; said Amna Al-Badi, who graduated last year and now attends Qatar University (QU). &#x201C;The ABP showed me how university life would actually be and it made me ready to attend QU.&#x201D;<br>\n <img width=\"341\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Malek%20Helali_TAMUQ-17.jpg\" alt=\"Malek Helali_TAMUQ.jpg\"><br>\n Beyond academic abilities, successful university students must manage their time and workload in order to complete assignments, meet deadlines, and study efficiently and effectively. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;One of the defining features of the ABP is that we teach not only subject matter competence, but also soft skills that are critical to student success, said Dr Mark Newmark, Assistant Director for Academic Affairs at the ABP. &#x201C;Those soft skills include seeking help when difficulties are encountered, keeping to deadlines, working with academic integrity, and getting to classes on time.&#x201D;<br>\n <img width=\"640\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/RESIZED%20Some%20Graduates%20from%20ABP%20Class%20of%202014-17.jpg\" alt=\"RESIZED Some Graduates from ABP Class of 2014.jpg\"><br>\n Student support services are another important benefit of the ABP system. This one-to-one attention is especially significant for students who wish to attend the prestigious schools of the Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) Partnership in Education City.<br>\n <br>\n This process, in addition to the focus on curricular content and soft skills, has led to the highest acceptance rate of students into HBKU Partner Universities in the history of the ABP. This past year, 42 percent of the ABP&#x2019;s graduates were offered admission to universities in Education City.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/PRESS-RELEASE_ABP_Success_25Jan_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24qf49","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/university-success-begins-at-abp","currSlug":"/media-center/university-success-begins-at-abp","title":"University Success Begins at ABP"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
