If his doesn&#x2019;t happen we are going to have a nation of sick kids who are insulin-dependent and who are going to die at a younger age than we are.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n At the Your Health First event, four recipes were cooked with the children: guacamole with baked tortilla chips; fruit smoothies; avocado and chicken wrap; and jelly muffins. Another family-oriented recipe - grilled, marinated chicken with yoghurt - was demonstrated to the adults present.<br>\n <br>\n <img width=\"357\" height=\"255\" alt=\"Healthy_Cooking_M8422.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Healthy_Cooking_M8422-9.jpg\"> Cookery books containing 32 recipes suitable for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks were then distributed, providing parents with plenty of ideas for nutritious, tasty meals that the whole family would enjoy. Chef Cooper also gave parents hints and tips on how to make a healthy lunch that children could take to school with them.<br>\n <br>\n The aim of the Your Health First event, which was held at the Diplomatic Club in West Bay, was to get children interested in cooking healthy food and to teach parents that cooking healthy meals does not have to be time-consuming or complicated. <br>\n <br>\n Dieticians from Qatar Foundation were also on hand to offer advice to parents and children about planning meals, nutrition and the best things to eat. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/131121%20English%20International%20chef%20inspires%20children%20and%20adults%20to%20eat%20healthily%20at%20cooking%20demonstration.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf48","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/international-chef-inspires-children-and-adults-to-eat-healthily-at-cooking-demonstration","currSlug":"/media-center/international-chef-inspires-children-and-adults-to-eat-healthily-at-cooking-demonstration","title":"International Chef Inspires Children And Adults To Eat Healthily At Cooking Demonstration"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
