Our institute has been tasked with addressing health challenges that are projected to be a cause of concern in Qatari society.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n On November 20, HBKU and the wider QF community were invited to participate in a diabetes risk assessment session at the HBKU Research Complex, where they had their blood sugar levels and blood pressure tested, along with their height and weight.
