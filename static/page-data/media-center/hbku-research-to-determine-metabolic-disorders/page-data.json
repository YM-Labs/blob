By using a technique called &#x201C;metabolomics profiling&#x201D;, and advanced statistical analysis methods the scientists used serum samples from the women to compare their metabolism and gain an instantaneous snapshot of the physiology of their whole body. Their research indicated a significant difference between the metabolic profiles of the two groups.<br>\n <br>\n The research study offers insight into the biological mechanisms behind metabolic differences and may have an impact in helping identify predictive markers of insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity, making preventative care possible in Qatar and beyond. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Omar El Agnaf, the acting executive director of QBRI, added: &#x201C;This QBRI-supported study furthers our aim to take an integrative and multidisciplinary approach in providing crucial insights into a key healthcare concerns in Qatar. By participating in collaborative studies like this one, we hope to continue to advance knowledge and champion the cause of fostering innovation in research.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/161029_UN%20Social%20Forum%20Dena%20Al-Thani_Final_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf32","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-research-to-determine-metabolic-disorders","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-research-to-determine-metabolic-disorders","title":"HBKU Research to Determine Metabolic Disorders"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
