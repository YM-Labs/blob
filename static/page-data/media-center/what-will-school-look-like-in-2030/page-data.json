Schools will become interactive environments where innovations in technology and curricula will fundamentally transform the role of teachers and reshape the landscape of learning. <br>\n <br>\n The survey reveals a strong consensus around the idea that innovation is an integral part of the future of education. A resounding 93 percent of the experts say they favor schools that implement innovative methods based on new teaching approaches and creative processes. <br>\n <br>\n Experts from the WISE community predict that schools will evolve to become learning networks. Online resources and technologies will support peer-to-peer networking, dialogue and exchange, facilitating a move towards collaborative learning. According to the survey, almost half of the experts (43 percent) believe that content will be provided predominantly by online platforms, while only 29 percent ranked brick-and-mortar schools as the primary source of knowledge. <br>\n <img width=\"304\" height=\"426\" alt=\"WISE Graph.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/WISE%20Graph-17.jpg\"><br>\n However the experts emphasize that innovation comes in many forms, not just technological.<br>\n <br>\n Seventy five percent of the experts surveyed believe that the most valued assets in 2030 will be personal and interpersonal skills. Only 42 percent think that academic knowledge will continue to be valuable to learners. <br>\n <br>\n Eighty three percent of experts also believe that content will become more individualized, reflecting each student&#x2019;s needs. Another key finding supports the evolution of the teacher&#x2019;s role towards being a learning facilitator rather than a lecturer.<br>\n <br>\n Experts remain divided on the issue of certification and assessment; 39 percent think that diplomas will continue to be the most important method of assessment while another third (37 percent) argue that professional certifications assessing abilities such as management, collaboration or creativity will play a more important role. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/WISE%20releases%20survey%20results%20What%20will%20school%20look%20like%20in%202030.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf7","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/what-will-school-look-like-in-2030","currSlug":"/media-center/what-will-school-look-like-in-2030","title":"What Will School Look Like in 2030?"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
