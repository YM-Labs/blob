This is the information vacuum the student researchers seek to fill.<br>\n <br>\n Al-Khater explained: &quot;One of the most valuable experiences from the research process through UREP is making the step into the real world to collect data and being able to test hypotheses and draw conclusions on what we have been able to observe ourselves rather than sticking purely to data that people have reported in the past.&quot;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We had to go through training and learn how to ethically undertake projects involving behavioral research,&#x201D; added Mahsud. <br>\n &#x201C;The actual survey-giving experience requires patience and care. We learned how best to formulate surveys and how to approach potential survey takers. The project has also taught me a lot about the city of Doha, but also about urban space in general.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Georgetown&#x2019;s website, please <a href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/424711.html#.Utz7HftRXGg\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf92","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/georgetown-students-analyze-qatars-urban-planning","currSlug":"/media-center/georgetown-students-analyze-qatars-urban-planning","title":"Georgetown Students Analyze Qatar's Urban Planning"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
