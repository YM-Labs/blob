We look forward to caring for the children, young people and women of Qatar in the new state-of-the art hospital. As we gear up to welcome our first inpatients on 14 January, their continued safety and comfort is of utmost importance to us. Inpatient services at the main hospital are being phased over the course of 2018. We are working very closely with our partners at HMC and PHCC to ensure that the care and services patients receive are transitioned as smoothly as possible.&#x201D;<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/04%20-%20Sidra%20Medicine%20-%20Surgery%20Room%20sm-24.jpg\" alt=\"04 - Sidra Medicine - Surgery Room sm.jpg\" width=\"560\" height=\"300\"><br>\n Dr. Abdulla Al Kaabi, Executive Chair of the Children&#x2019;s Services Clinical Management Group, Executive Vice Chief Medical Officer and Member of the Board of Governors, said: &#x201C;We are less than three weeks out from taking one of the biggest steps in helping to advance the specialist care of children and adolescents and maternity services in Qatar.
