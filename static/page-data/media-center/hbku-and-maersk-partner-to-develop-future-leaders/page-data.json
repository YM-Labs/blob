Each day will focus on a specific theme including, &#x2019;Building Community,&#x2019; &#x2019;The Value of One, Power of All,&#x2019; and &#x2019;Bringing Vision to Reality.&#x2019; <br>\n <br>\n Sixty students from HBKU&#x2019;s partner universities have been selected to participate in this highly competitive program.
