But it is constantly expanding and by the end of the year it is expected that about 70 schools will have the greenhouses. Eventually it is hoped that every independent school in Qatar will be included in the initiative. <br>\n <br>\n The scheme&#x2019;s vision is to teach young people about the environment, sustainability, where food comes from and the types of foods that they should eat to stay healthy. The aim is to halt the growth of diabetes and obesity and help create a healthy generation able to meet the needs of Qatar National Vision 2030.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/150519%20English%20Trophy%20for%20green-fingered%20primary%20school%20students.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24qf22","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/trophy-for-green-fingered-primary-school-students","currSlug":"/media-center/trophy-for-green-fingered-primary-school-students","title":"Trophy for Green-Fingered Primary School Students"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
