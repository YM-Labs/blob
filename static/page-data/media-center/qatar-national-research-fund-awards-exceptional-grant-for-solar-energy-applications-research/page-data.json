The study promises to revolutionize the field of solar cells, placing Qatar at the forefront of a niche and critical research area.<br>\n <br>\n Led by Dr Sabre Kais, a Principal Investigator for computation and theory at QEERI, the project seeks to provide the means to surmount obstacles inherent in known bulk semiconductor devices using &#x2018;excitonics&#x2019;. The technology has the potential to make a significant impact not only on the development of solar cells, but also on the next generation optoelectronics and photonics - where the fundamental issue is the efficient transport of energy over long distances.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/09.05.15.QNRF%20NPRP-EP%20Batch%207%20PR.EN.FINAL.pdf\">click here</a>.</strong><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15qf40","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-national-research-fund-awards-exceptional-grant-for-solar-energy-applications-research","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-national-research-fund-awards-exceptional-grant-for-solar-energy-applications-research","title":"Qatar National Research Fund Awards Exceptional Grant for Solar Energy Applications Research"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
