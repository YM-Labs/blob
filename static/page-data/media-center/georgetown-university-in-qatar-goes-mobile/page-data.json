The launch of the &#x2019;Georgetown Mobile&#x2018; app will now allow students to track the school&#x2019;s transportation schedule, access the school&#x2019;s library, as well as view the university&#x2019;s extensive collection of research, news, and public lectures on video, directly from their mobile devices.<br>\n <br>\n The Georgetown Mobile app is available for free download from the Appstore and Google Play. <br>\n Those with other operating systems may access the same content simply by pointing phone and tablet browsers to: <a href=\"http://m.qatar.georgetown.edu\" target=\"_blank\">m.qatar.georgetown.edu</a>/.<br>\n <br>\n <a href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/404943.html#\" target=\"_blank\"> To read the full article on Georgetown&#x2019;s website, please click here. </a><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5qf2","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/georgetown-university-in-qatar-goes-mobile","currSlug":"/media-center/georgetown-university-in-qatar-goes-mobile","title":"Georgetown University In Qatar Goes Mobile"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
