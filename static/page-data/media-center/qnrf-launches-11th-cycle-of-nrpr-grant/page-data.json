The call for the submission of proposals for NPRP 11 is now open, with those that succeed to be awarded during 2018.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Abdul Sattar Al-Taie, Executive Director, QNRF, said: &#x201C;Over the last 10 years, QNRF has been the foremost enabler of Qatar&#x2019;s research and development landscape, and QNRF&#x2019;s latest version of the NPRP illustrates our versatility and commitment to continually enhancing and sharpening the support we provide to the nation&#x2019;s research community.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;However, while the NPRP continues to evolve, its core purpose &#x2013; as an engine for generating knowledge assets that can make a significant contribution to the sustainable diversification of Qatar&#x2019;s economy &#x2013; remains constant.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The structure of the research teams supported under NPRP-C has been upgraded to allow multiple sub-projects, each with its own Lead Principal Investigator, to be clustered together and steered by a Program Director. <br>\n <br>\n Meanwhile, NPRP-S proposals will follow the standard model, namely single projects with one Lead Principal Investigator to focus on pre-determined priority themes within the areas of energy and environment; information and communications technology; biomedical and health; and social sciences, arts, and humanities.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_QNRF_NPRP_Cycle11Launch_PressRelease_EN_20171122.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf38","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qnrf-launches-11th-cycle-of-nrpr-grant","currSlug":"/media-center/qnrf-launches-11th-cycle-of-nrpr-grant","title":"QNRF Launches 11th Cycle of NRPR Grant"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
