Young Adult author, Eissa Abdullah, will hold a session that will explore writing for the unique market of Young Adults. Abdullah will delve into the specifics of character development and tone of voice regarding this ever-expanding niche market. This is definitely a session not to be missed by anyone interested in gaining perspective as an author geared towards young adult readers. <br>\n <br>\n Another forum will center around the critical biography, Saladin, written by Dr. Abdul Rahman Azzam. Saladin was one of the most famous players in Islamic history. This ground-breaking biography uncovers the real Saladin, placing him in historical context against the backdrop of the 10th and 11th-century Sunni revival, a powerful sweeping intellectual renaissance that would ultimately transform every field of Islamic thought. <br>\n <br>\n For those interested in this facet of the publishing world, Dr. Alwaleed AlKhaja, Senior Editor at HBKU Press, will hold a session that will examine the developmental process of how to publish an academic book with HBKU Press. <br>\n <br>\n HBKU Press will crown its participation in this year&#x2019;s book fair with a much-anticipated book signing and meet and greet with best-selling Qatari author, Abdulaziz Al-Mahmoud.
