The workshop focused on innovation in photovoltaic technologies titled &#x201C;Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) Technologies and their Application to Qatar and the MENA Region&#x201D;. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/NT7_3717%5B6%5D.jpg\" alt=\"NT7_3717[6].jpg\" height=\"1102\" width=\"1664\"><br>\n The event was organized by QEERI in collaboration with Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics (Fraunhofer-CSP, Germany) and IRESEN (Research Institute for Solar Energy and New Energies) and sponsored by Qatar National Research Fund.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/NT7_3801%5B4%5D.jpg\" alt=\"NT7_3801[4].jpg\" height=\"1102\" width=\"1664\"><br>\n The 90 participants included scientists from research organizations and experts in the field of real estate and construction, with local entities such as Kahramaa, Msheireb Properties, Qatar Electricity and Water Company (QEWC), The Supreme Committee for Legacy and Delivery and Siemens represented at the event. International delegates from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the United States of America, and Australia attended.<br>\n <br>\n The event showcased the advantages and resources available for Qatar to integrate photovoltaics (PV) technology in the urban environment, allowing buildings to be converted from energy users to energy producers. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/NT7_3804%5B5%5D.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"1102\" width=\"1664\"><br>\n At the workshop, architects and building engineers learnt how PV systems can be introduced in buildings with good design, structures and energy concepts, as well as how BIPV products can be multifunctional (electricity generation, weather protection, heat insulation, sun protection, noise protection, modulation of daylight, and security).<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/NT7_3789%5B7%5D.jpg\" alt=\"NT7_3789[7].jpg\" height=\"1102\" width=\"1664\"><br>\n The BIPV workshop also included research posters from local and international scientists. The workshop concluded with a ceremony for the Young Contest Award, where five students from Hamad bin Khalifa University and Qatar University received awards for their innovative projects in solar photovoltaics.<br>\n <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160207_HBKU%20QEERI_English.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>click here.</u></strong></a><strong><br>\n </strong></div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong> &#xA0;</strong></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17qf1","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qeeri-holds-workshop-on-photovoltaic-innovation-in-qatar-and-the-mena-region","currSlug":"/media-center/qeeri-holds-workshop-on-photovoltaic-innovation-in-qatar-and-the-mena-region","title":"QEERI Holds Workshop on Photovoltaic Innovation in Qatar and the MENA Region"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
