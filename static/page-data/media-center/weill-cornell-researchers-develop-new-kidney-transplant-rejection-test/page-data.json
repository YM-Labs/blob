It is always very exciting to make a discovery that has the potential to lead to a real clinical application that will make healthcare better for patients.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The study, entitled <em>Urine Metabolite Profiles Predictive of Human Kidney Allograft Status</em>, can be read in full at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/early/2015/06/05/ASN.2015010107.abstract\">http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/early/2015/06/05/ASN.2015010107.abstract </a><br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/150706%20English%20Weill%20Cornell%20researchers%20develop%20new%20kidney%20transplant%20rejection%20test.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf5","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/weill-cornell-researchers-develop-new-kidney-transplant-rejection-test","currSlug":"/media-center/weill-cornell-researchers-develop-new-kidney-transplant-rejection-test","title":"Weill Cornell Researchers Develop New Kidney Transplant Rejection Test"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
