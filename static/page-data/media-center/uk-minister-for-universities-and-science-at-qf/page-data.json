Dr Willetts highlighted the UK&#x2019;s engagement in science and innovation, and stressed his support for new collaborations that will benefit both nations.</p>\n <p>&#x201C;Education is clearly absolutely fundamental to future economic development, and you have got very ambitious plans for more education and we want to work with you and cooperate in ensuring that as many Qataris as possible have the opportunity of achieving their potential,&#x201D; explained Dr Willetts. &#x201C;I think certainly investing in education is crucially important and, looking at these plans, I think they are incredibly ambitious and far-sighted and they rival anything that is planned anywhere in the Middle East. I am here to see how we can cooperate to make that happen.&#x201D;</p>\n <p>He added, &#x201C;In London, I had the great privilege of meeting HH Sheikha Moza at the Royal Society when we were witnessing the signature of the agreement with University College London that we were setting up here, its facility focusing on museums, and I have also seen at the British Library the research materials that we are going to be sharing with Qatar about Qatar&apos;s own history so there are already those connections, but we need to do a lot more and I am here to push that forward.&#x201D;</p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24qf42","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/uk-minister-for-universities-and-science-at-qf","currSlug":"/media-center/uk-minister-for-universities-and-science-at-qf","title":"UK Minister For Universities And Science at QF"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
