Twenty-five young education advocates from 22 countries, with diverse backgrounds and disciplines, have been selected to join the international Learners&#x2019; Voice community. The new cohort will engage in dialogue on pressing education issues including practical, action-oriented approaches to the crisis of global forced migration and displacement. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Wise-Prize-for-Education-2013.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1.jpg\" height=\"302\" width=\"450\"><br>\n The WISE Learners&#x2019; Voice program brings the voice of young people to the challenge of rethinking education, and equips them to take on leading roles in their fields and in the world of education. The program focuses on building their knowledge of education, as well as their communication, entrepreneurship, and leadership skills. <br>\n <br>\n Stavros N. Yiannouka, CEO, WISE, an initiative of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF), remarked: &#x201C;At WISE we are very excited to introduce the new cohort of the Learners&#x2019; Voice Program for 2017-2018.The WISE team has worked hard to bring together this unique group of young people with diverse backgrounds and experiences, who share a commitment to education for individual empowerment and social change. Many of them have already faced life-changing experiences and challenges, whether as refugees themselves, or as teachers and advocates in diverse and difficult situations around the globe. I am confident that they and their peers will bring to the WISE community a new and vital energy towards building the future of education.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n In addition to their participation at the 2017 WISE Summit in Doha this November, the newest Learners&#x2019; Voice cohort will join two intensive residential sessions delivered by expert faculty members, as well as a variety of online and on-site activities. In a key component of the program, in January 2018, the Learners will form teams to conceive and design innovative projects that address critical education challenges. After thorough evaluation by the Learners&#x2019; Voice team, selected projects will have an opportunity to pitch their proposals to an audience of potential investors, donors, and partners next year. <br>\n <br>\n Maria Constanza Cardinali, a 2017-2018 Learner from Argentina, said: &quot;I became interested in the WISE Learners&#x2019; Voice program because I think education brings freedom. This program will help me rethink global perspectives by sharing, listening, and discussing education with experts and young people from diverse cultures. I hope to gain more awareness of global issues, and learn new skills for tackling the current challenges of education.&quot;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_WISE_LVP_PressRelease_EN_20170829%20(1).pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf30","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-announces-new-learners-voice-cohort","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-announces-new-learners-voice-cohort","title":"WISE Announces New Learners’ Voice Cohort"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
