The virus can also be transmitted from mothers to their children during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. <br>\n <br>\n If untreated, hepatitis C can cause severe liver cirrhosis, which in some cases leads to liver cancer and death. Up to 150 million people worldwide are believed to have hepatitis C and 350,000 to 500,000 die each year from hepatitis C-related liver disease. Egypt has the highest rate of hepatitis C infection in the world, with 14.7 percent of the population carrying the virus. Infection rates are relatively low in the Gulf region and in Qatar 1.1 percent of the population have the virus. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Abu-Raddad said the hepatitis C disease burden is growing but that new hope emerged just over a year ago when the world&#x2019;s first truly effective hepatitis C drug was launched. Unfortunately, the new drug comes with an eye-watering price tag of $84,000 for a full 12-week course.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Abu-Raddad said: &#x201C;We now hope that the price of this new generation of medications will fall considerably so that these drugs can be made available to large numbers of people, which has already started to happen. In Egypt, for example, the government was able to negotiate a large discount on the drug and has begun a program that has so far treated more than 400,000 people. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Other countries are developing their own programs and I am very hopeful that in the future we will be able to dramatically reduce the incidence and prevalence of hepatitis C in the MENA region, relieving many people from the misery of the disease.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/150630%20English%20WCMC-Q%20Grand%20Rounds%20warns%20of%20MENA%20hepatitis%20C%20crisis.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf65","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcmc-q-event-warns-of-mena-hepatitis-c-crisis","currSlug":"/media-center/wcmc-q-event-warns-of-mena-hepatitis-c-crisis","title":"WCMC-Q Event Warns of MENA Hepatitis C Crisis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
