It is important to note that not all seizures are the result of epilepsy and a few other conditions such as sleep disorders and syncope may mimic epilepsy and present with seizure-like symptoms like impaired awareness, loss of consciousness and unusual behaviors and responses.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Uthman explained that epilepsy could be the result of inborn genetic abnormalities in the brain, metabolic disorders, brain injuries caused by trauma, or brain damage caused by aneurysm, stroke, oxygen deprivation or a brain tumor, among other things. <br>\n <br>\n It is estimated that around one per cent of people worldwide are affected by epilepsy, though the great majority are seizure-free with treatment. One-quarter to one-third continue to have seizures in spite of medications. Seizures do not always involve convulsions but can take the appearance of momentary fixed staring or mild trembling.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/151129%20English%20Complexities%20of%20seizure%20diagnosis%20discussed%20at%20WCM-Q%20Grand%20Rounds.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf29","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/complexities-of-seizure-diagnosis-discussed-at-wcm-q-grand-rounds","currSlug":"/media-center/complexities-of-seizure-diagnosis-discussed-at-wcm-q-grand-rounds","title":"Complexities of Seizure Diagnosis Discussed at WCM-Q Grand Rounds"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
