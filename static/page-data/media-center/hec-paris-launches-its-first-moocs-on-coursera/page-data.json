The initial two courses will be on the topics of European Law and Corporate Finance respectively, with one course in English, and one in French. Both are being specifically developed for the platform and will take advantage of all the technological potential only MOOCs can offer.<br>\n <br>\n The concept of MOOCs &#x2013; free, universally accessible knowledge &#x2013; appeals to HEC Paris as a way of expanding its expertise and knowledge, and sharing them with a wider, global audience. <br>\n <br>\n Following the success of its iTunes U platform (which has totaled over two million downloads in just three years) HEC Paris is experimenting with another new model for education in a bid to improve teaching via technology. <br>\n <br>\n Coursera is an education company that partners with the top universities and organizations in the world to offer courses online for anyone to take, for free and 444 courses are available from 87 prestigious universities. www.coursera.org<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/HEC%20Paris%20MOOC%20Release_EN%20-%20Final.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8qf50","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hec-paris-launches-its-first-moocs-on-coursera","currSlug":"/media-center/hec-paris-launches-its-first-moocs-on-coursera","title":"HEC Paris Launches Its First MOOCs On Coursera"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
