These stories stay with the reader forever as they are marked with important lessons taught and learned through larger-than-life situations, spun with a touch of fantasy and imagination.<br>\n <br>\n For local Qatari author, Dr. Kaltham Ali Al-Ghanim, the year was 1989 when she first heard the story of Ghosoun and her Brother the Gazelle from a wizened, eighty-year-old woman which stuck with her for over 25 years. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Ghosoun%20AR%20COVER-24.jpg\" alt=\"Ghosoun AR COVER.jpg\" width=\"560\" height=\"300\"><br>\n &#x201C;The woman who told me the story knew a lot of traditional, Qatari folkloric tales and was a master storyteller,&#x201D; explains Dr. Al-Ghanim. &#x201C;She had a special way of bringing a story alive and this particular story stuck with me. I was attracted to the special relationship between a girl and her brother, and their relationship with a dog. Years later, when I started writing for children, I remembered this tale, and knew I wanted to share it with kids in a captivating manner so that it would stick with them as it had with me after all of these years.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n And so, Ghosoun and her Brother the Gazelle, an enchanting tale from Qatari heritage, newly published by Hamad Bin Khalifa University Press and available in bookstores in Qatar, has been passed on from one generation to the next.<br>\n <br>\n The tale depicts a brother and sister who live with their parents in peace and harmony, along with their loyal dog, Salfa. But with the sudden death of their mother, the children&#x2019;s father marries another woman who quickly conspires with an evil crow to be rid of the children and faithful Salfa.<br>\n <br>\n The children embark on a mysterious journey away from their home fraught with hardships, deceit, and magical enchantment, in the hope to someday live, once again, happily ever after.<br>\n <br>\n &#x202B;&#x201C;When the tale by Dr. Al-Ghanim was proposed to us, we at HBKU Press were not only extremely enthusiastic to publish such a well-written tale,&#x201D; explains Fakhri Saleh, Head of Arabic Publishing at HBKU Press, &#x201C;but we maintained that it is our duty to publish such a culturally-relevant tale of Qatari heritage as a Qatari publishing house that encourages and supports local authors and the local narrative.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n When it came to illustrating the story, Dr. Al-Ghanim and the editors at HBKU Press saw Ibtihaj Al-Harthi as the perfect match to illustrate the story.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Her artistic touch had the ability to brilliantly bring the characters and their actions to life,&#x201D; says Dr. Al-Ghanim.<br>\n <br>\n The award-winning Omani author and illustrator of another HBKU Press Children&#x2019;s book, Mah and Me, was also very enthusiastic to be a part of the project.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/07%2003%202017_HBKU%20Press%20highlights%20ENG.pdf\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf92","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-press-book-highlights-qatari-cultural-heritage","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-press-book-highlights-qatari-cultural-heritage","title":"HBKU Press Book Highlights Qatari Cultural Heritage"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
