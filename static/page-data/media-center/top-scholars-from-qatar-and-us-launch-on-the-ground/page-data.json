However, being &#x2018;on the ground&#x2019; is also a challenge for researchers who face pressure to constantly produce substantial findings, but researchers must always be vigilant and understand the high-paced environment in the Middle East.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n A digital English version of On the Ground is available at <a href=\"http://ontheground.qatar.northwestern.edu/\">http://ontheground.qatar.northwestern.edu/</a>.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/3_25_14_On%20the%20Ground%20Book%20Launch_ENG.Final.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24qf9","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/top-scholars-from-qatar-and-us-launch-on-the-ground","currSlug":"/media-center/top-scholars-from-qatar-and-us-launch-on-the-ground","title":"Top Scholars from Qatar and US Launch ‘On the Ground’"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
