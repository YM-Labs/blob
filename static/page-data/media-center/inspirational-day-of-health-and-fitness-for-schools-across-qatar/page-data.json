The Challenge perfectly demonstrates the importance of education and exercise, which are two essential pillars in achieving that goal. At QOC, we are proud to be supporting such an inspiring initiative in line with our Sport Strategy, aimed at achieving the objectives of the Qatar National Vision 2030.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n In addition to the interschool contest, The Challenge also offered the audience the chance to have their health and fitness professionally assessed through the use of a body analyzing machine and the AGE (advanced glycation end products) reader. The latter measures the amount of sugar-containing proteins in the body and can provide an indication of the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in later life. The former provides participants with a full breakdown of the components of their body &#x2013; the amount of muscle, fat and bone that they are carrying. It also gives an indication of a person&#x2019;s metabolic age as opposed to their chronological age.<br>\n <br>\n Engineer Saad Al Muhannadi, President of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development said: &#x201C;Qatar Foundation is keen to engage in various activities, which have been designed to raise awareness among community members about the importance of health and fitness.
