We found mechanisms that allow calcium ions to travel within an intracellular structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which acts as a communication hub to distribute Ca2+ to a distant effector.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The paper, entitled Mid-range Ca2+ signaling mediated by functional coupling between store-operated Ca2+ entry and IP3-dependent Ca2+ release, was published on 28 May 2014 and can be found at NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 5:3916 | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms4916 |<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/naturecommunications\" target=\"_blank\">www.nature.com/naturecommunications</a>. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/140615%20English%20High-level%20research%20success%20for%20WCMC-Q%20scientists.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf14","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/high-level-research-success-for-wcmc-q-scientists","currSlug":"/media-center/high-level-research-success-for-wcmc-q-scientists","title":"High-Level Research Success for WCMC-Q Scientists"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
