Representatives from approximately 30 universities in Qatar, the US, Britain and Germany participated in the 2014 ABP College Fair. <br>\n <br>\n This was a golden opportunity for the ABP students learn more about the admissions requirements for entry into world class universities. <br>\n <br>\n The universities that attended the fair included: College of the North Atlantic-Qatar, Creighton University, DePaul University, Indiana University, Jacobs University Bremen in Germany, Kent State University, Marquette University, McNeese State University, Middle Tennessee State University, Qatar University, Rochester Institute of Technology- Dubai, Savannah College of Art &amp; Design, Shoreline Community College, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, St. John&apos;s University, Stenden University Qatar, University Indianapolis, University of Calgary Qatar, University of Cincinnati, University of Colorado Boulder, University of Michigan-Flint, University of Southern California, University of Southern Florida, University of Toledo, University of West of England&#x2013;Bristol, Western Kentucky University, Western Michigan University, and Widener University.<br>\n <br>\n Students who perform well at the ABP and meet basic university admission requirements have the opportunity to enter directly into the first year of undergraduate programs at a number of universities in the UK, the US and Germany. <br>\n <br>\n In addition, students interested in joining certain universities in Qatar may be given credit for courses they took at the ABP. <br>\n In 2011, the ABP was awarded five years accreditation by the Commission on English Language Accreditation (CEA) in the United States. <br>\n <br>\n This makes it easier to fast-track ABP graduates into universities in the United States without the need for them to complete a university foundation year.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/ABP%20College%20Fair%202014_EN.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf18","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qfs-academic-bridge-program-hosts-international-college-fair","currSlug":"/media-center/qfs-academic-bridge-program-hosts-international-college-fair","title":"QF’s Academic Bridge Program Hosts International College Fair"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
