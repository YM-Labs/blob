Emotional intelligence (EQ) is made of four core skills: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship management. EQ is the foundation for a host of critical skills and the strongest predictor of high performance. <br>\n <br>\n The one-day workshop will be delivered by Ms. Maha Elnashar and Ms. Huda Abdelrahim from the Center for Cultural Competence in Healthcare (CCCHC) a unit of the Institute for Population Health, who are licensed by TalentSmart Inc. one of the world&#x2019;s top providers of EQ training.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo2%20(6)-24.jpg\" alt=\"Photo2 (6).JPG\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Published research shows that EQ education is needed in the medical sector as it helps enhance interpersonal and social communication skills and achieves a range of benefits including increased job satisfaction, improved performance and better patient-doctor relationships. It ensures people are treated equally and receive high-quality care. For example, studies demonstrate that some patients fail to follow instructions if they feel they have not been treated with sufficient respect, while doctors may misinterpret these emotions and be unaware of the patient&#x2019;s negative feelings towards them. Being emotionally intelligent means that individuals can recognize, understand and manage their feelings in positive ways, allowing them to better deal with highly stressful situations, improving their communication skills, and increasing empathy.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Ravinder Mamtani, senior associate dean for population health, capacity building and student affairs said the course would be an excellent fit for IPH&#x2019;s mission, and that improving a person&#x2019;s emotional intelligence would allow them to view their feelings critically, objectively and to react positively.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180319%20English%20New%20program%20to%20help%20healthcare%20professionals%20improve%20their%20interpersonal%20skills.pdf\">here</a>.<br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10qf86","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/new-wcm-q-course-to-improve-interpersonal-skills","currSlug":"/media-center/new-wcm-q-course-to-improve-interpersonal-skills","title":"New WCM-Q Course to Improve Interpersonal Skills"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
