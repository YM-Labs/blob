Thus it is not surprising that some of the most violent and thorough destruction of libraries in history has occurred during late twentieth-century ethnic conflicts.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The &#x2018;ethnic cleansing&#x2019; that took place in the 1990s during the Yugoslav Wars were accompanied by &#x201C;cultural cleansing&#x201D;, where throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, Muslim, Catholic and municipal libraries and archives were destroyed by nationalist Serbs. <br>\n <br>\n Looting of books and libraries occurred on an unprecedented scale when the Third Reich, well known as destroyers of books, targeted Jewish, socialist and Masonic libraries. &#x201C;Sometimes the stated goal was &#x2018;research and analysis&#x2019; of enemies of the regime or the nation,&#x201D; said Dr. Sutter, &#x201C;In other instances, the declared aims were enriching German library collections or restocking damaged libraries.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;And so it is in times of war,&#x201D; said Dr. Sutter, &#x201C;that books, like people, have their fate; and those fates often intertwine.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Georgetown&apos;s website, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/421766.html#\">click here</a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf63","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/the-fate-of-libraries-in-wartime","currSlug":"/media-center/the-fate-of-libraries-in-wartime","title":"The Fate Of Libraries In Wartime"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
