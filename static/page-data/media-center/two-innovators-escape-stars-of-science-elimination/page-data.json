The resourceful Mohammed Al-Jefairi and the astute Ahmad Nabeel persevered, leaving behind fellow innovator Wissam Manshi and his robotic Arabic coffee waiter invention. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/sos3-24.jpg\" alt=\"sos3.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n In this week&#x2019;s episode, Mohammed showcased his innovation, an interactive robot that harnesses the latest technological advancements to teach deaf children Arabic sign language. Ahmad demonstrated his self-cleaning laparoscope lens, which he hopes will revolutionize how doctors perform surgery. Wissam displayed his robotic Arabic coffee waiter, programmed to automatically pour a perfect cup of coffee from a della, a traditional Arabic coffee pot.<br>\n <br>\n Mohammed, who is now one step closer to the final round, said: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m driven to help our society become more inclusive to those who use Arabic sign language to communicate. I hope my invention will bring early childhood sign language instruction into the 21st century.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;As an innovator, I&#x2019;m always ready for a new challenge,&#x201D; said Ahmad Nabeel. &#x201C;The next stage of Stars of Science is going to test my skills in ways I can&#x2019;t yet imagine &#x2013; but I&#x2019;m looking forward to it.&#x201D;<br>\n Two prototyping episodes remain. Six innovators out of nine will emerge to compete in the next stage of the competition &#x2013; the customer validation round.<br>\n <br>\n Stars of Science, the flagship &#x201C;edutainment reality&#x201D; TV format initiated by Qatar Foundation, is the Arab world&#x2019;s leading innovation show that enables the region&#x2019;s aspiring science and technology entrepreneurs. <br>\n <br>\n Throughout the season nine candidates are challenged to develop creative solutions to regional problems within the fields of information technology, energy, environment, and health.
