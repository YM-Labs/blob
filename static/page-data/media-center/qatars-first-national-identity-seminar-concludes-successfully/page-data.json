The Arabic language is facing a challenge be it through poor curricula, lack of motivation among teachers or simply not enough training. Overcoming the challenges facing Arabic language is essential to preserving our identity.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Mr Mohammed Ali Abdullah, Expert on Cultural Architecture, gave a speech on identity through architecture in Qatar: &#x201C;Identity reflects a number of notions that people acquire throughout their lives, and is usually influenced by language, culture, social traditions, and location. Architectural identity is no different, and the identity of architecture in the Gulf region is unique in every shape and form. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;It is important to emphasize, however, that identity changes through time. Our identity now differs from where it was during at the beginning of the century. Evolution of our identity has been going on for the past 4,000 years. An attempt to preserve a &#x2018;pure&#x2019; identity based on ethnicity, religion, and culture is unrealistic, as we aim at enriching our culture and others, yet opening up to other cultures.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QATAR%20FIRST%20NATIONAL%20IDENTITY%20SEMINAR%20CONCLUDES%20SUCCESSFULLY_PR_E_211014_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong>.</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15qf79","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatars-first-national-identity-seminar-concludes-successfully","currSlug":"/media-center/qatars-first-national-identity-seminar-concludes-successfully","title":"Qatar’s First National Identity Seminar Concludes Successfully"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
