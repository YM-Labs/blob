Delegates from more than 100 countries are expected to attend, including nearly 40 minister-level representatives.<br>\n <br>\n Leading healthcare experts met in Doha today where they discussed WISH&#x2019;s dedication to capturing and disseminating the best evidence-based ideas in Qatar, throughout the region and around the world. The third WISH Summit will unveil new research in several key areas, including policy briefings on patient safety, dementia, affordable cancer care and learning from internal collaboration.<br>\n <br>\n Professor the Lord Ara Darzi, Executive Chair of WISH, said: &#x201C;Around the world our health systems face enormous challenges. Never has the need for innovation been greater nor opportunity to work together larger. The World Innovation Summit for Health brings the world to Qatar and Qatar to the world - as a convener, innovator and leader in health. More than a thousand of the world&apos;s top experts are gathering here in Doha for what promises to be an important and historic meeting. I&apos;m looking forward to the summit opening tomorrow morning and welcoming our guests from across the globe.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n In addition to the policy briefings, WISH Research Forums will share their reports on Accountable Care, Autism, Behavioral Insights, Cardiovascular Disease, Genomics in the Gulf Region and Islamic Ethics, Healthy Populations, Investing in Health, and Precision Medicine. <br>\n <br>\n In 2016, WISH partnered with the Carter Center to train a cohort of journalists through the Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism, which supports accurate reporting on mental health issues. In September, four local journalists received training at the centre. In June 2016, WISH participated at the Global Health Policy Forum hosted by Health Affairs, the world&#x2019;s leading health policy journal, in Washington, DC. Since 2014, Health Affairs has published 20 peer-reviewed articles based on WISH Forum reports. <br>\n <br>\n Each year, WISH highlights innovations in healthcare through its Young Innovators Competition and Young Innovators and Young Leaders programmes, which serve as platforms to showcase tomorrow&#x2019;s most promising healthcare leaders. Their innovations include devices, applications, innovative delivery models and design-based solutions that improve quality of care and patient experience, while also reducing the cost of care. The WISH 2016 Innovation Showcases provide a chance for entrepreneurs to exhibit their healthcare innovations and enables delegates to engage with ideas that are changing healthcare from the ground up. <br>\n <br>\n In addition to the annual summit, WISH has several ongoing projects, including Global Diffusion of Healthcare Innovation (GDHI), an assessment of how healthcare systems around the world adopt new innovations and spread them successfully, with the aim of inspiring other countries to adopt the best methods and ideas. It also examines the cultural behaviors that influence the spread of new ideas, such as the way each country engages with healthcare professionals, patients and the wider public, and highlights particular areas where countries are creating these conditions.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD-EC-WISH-PressConference%20EN%20PR-2016%2011%2028.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br>\n <br>\n &#xA0;</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf81","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-2016-leaders-highlight-value-of-healthcare-collaboration","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-2016-leaders-highlight-value-of-healthcare-collaboration","title":"WISH 2016 Leaders Highlight Value of Healthcare Collaboration"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
