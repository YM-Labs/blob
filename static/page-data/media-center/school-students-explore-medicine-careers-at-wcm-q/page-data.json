They also had the chance to take a dissection class in the WCM-Q biology lab, learn about the human heart by working with Harvey &#x2013; a hi-tech robotic humanoid learning aid &#x2013; in the state-of-the-art Clinical Skills Center, and visit Hamad Medical Corporation, WCM-Q&#x2019;s clinical partner. <br>\n <br>\n Overall, the students gained a comprehensive snapshot of what it is like to study medicine while also discovering some of the many career paths that a WCM-Q MD degree can lead to, which broadly include practice in a variety of medical specialties, biomedical research, and teaching, or a combination of all three. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo2%20(1)-17.jpg\" alt=\"Photo2 (1).jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n Qatari student Fatma Essa Al-Kubaisi of the International School of London, Qatar, completed the PCEP program. She said: &#x201C;My experience at WCM-Q&#x2019;s Summer Enrichment Program was beyond expectation. I got a taste of university life, made new friends, and developed and discovered my skills through different sessions. The two-week program provided me with a fantastic and unique opportunity that every prospective medicine student would wish to have.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Other highlights of the two-week programs included classes on animal care and use in research, an introduction to medical ethics, and a chance to meet current WCM-Q medical students and graduates for a Q&amp;A session. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo3-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n Dr. Clare McVeigh, Senior Lecturer in Biology, guided the visiting students through a dissection class, which was a completely new experience for most of group. Dr. McVeigh said: &#x201C;Dissecting a frog for the first time is an excellent learning experience for prospective medical students, giving them an opportunity to develop their manual dexterity and also to apply what they know from textbooks to a real organism. The students responded extremely well and took full advantage of the learning experience.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170806%20English%20College-bound%20students%20explore%20careers%20in%20medicine%20at%20WCM-Q.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20qf94","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/school-students-explore-medicine-careers-at-wcm-q","currSlug":"/media-center/school-students-explore-medicine-careers-at-wcm-q","title":"School Students Explore Medicine Careers at WCM-Q"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
