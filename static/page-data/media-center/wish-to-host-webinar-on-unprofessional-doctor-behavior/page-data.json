That is why we decided to focus this program on patient safety for the entire year. No other program has ever done benchmarking and best practice on a global scale in this way before and we are proud to have Qatar Foundation lead the way for the benefit of patients everywhere.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/05_10_2015_WISH%20Unprofessional%20Doctors%20Webinar_pr_Eng_FINAL.pdf\">click here. </a>&#xA0;</strong></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28qf46","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-to-host-webinar-on-unprofessional-doctor-behavior","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-to-host-webinar-on-unprofessional-doctor-behavior","title":"WISH to Host Webinar on Unprofessional Doctor Behavior"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
