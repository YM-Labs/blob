He can draw a direct line between his education and the skills he uses in his career. &#x201C;There is a lot of focus on mathematics, calculations, and economics, but also let&#x2019;s not forget what really makes CMU-Q graduates special: their interpersonal skills,&#x201D; he said. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Hussein%20Hejji-17.jpg\" alt=\"Hussein Hejji.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n &#x201C;The courses you take at CMU-Q prepare you for working in this respect. At work, it&#x2019;s not just the quality of data that matters, it&#x2019;s also the way you present and put things together.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n As technology becomes infused in nearly every aspect of big business, Hajji also sees an advantage for CMU-Q graduates: &#x201C;This program is unique, as you are exposed to mandatory programming and computer courses,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;These skills set us apart from other business graduates.&#x201D; <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Mohammed%20Hadi%20Takiddin-17.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammed Hadi Takiddin.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n Mohammed Al-Rawahi, who joined Commercial Bank of Qatar soon after graduation, worked as an analyst and corporate assistant for three years, and now works for Oman Aviation in Muscat, said: &#x201C;Business Administration is quite a comprehensive program. Along with preparing you for your specific area, it gives you a general idea of how things work. CMU-Q provided us with great skills, which I think can be used anywhere, whichever industry we are in.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Studying in Qatar, you have many opportunities to learn, and we developed the transferable skills that you need at every job.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Mohammed Hadi Takiddin, head of finance in the commercial branch of Qatar Museums, commented&#x201D; &#x201C;My studies at CMU-Q were about how to become a better person, and how to think outside the box so you can stand out in the marketplace.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Takiddin has worked at Qatar Museums since graduation, and he credits his success and ability to handle pressure on a solid educational foundation: &#x201C;My major in Business Administration was one of the best decisions of my life.
