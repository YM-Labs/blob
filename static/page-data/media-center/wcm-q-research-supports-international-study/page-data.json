Previously, only a small fraction of these associations were known, mainly because researchers could measure only a few blood proteins simultaneously in a robust manner.<br>\n <br>\n The researchers used technology developed by a company called SomaLogic to measure 3,600 proteins in the blood of 3,300 people, then analyzed the DNA of these individuals to see which regions of their genomes were associated with protein levels, yielding a four-fold increase on the study previously published by WCM-Q. <br>\n <br>\n The new study has been published in Nature, a leading scientific journal. The earlier study was supported by the Biomedical Research Program (BMRP) of Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, a program supported by QF. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Karsten Suhre, Professor of Physiology and Biophysics and Director of the Bioinformatics Core, WCM-Q, led the earlier research in Qatar, which revealed many previously unknown links between genetic variations and a series of debilitating conditions, including Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, heart disease, autoimmune disorders and cancer. Following publication of these findings, Dr. Suhre was asked to participate in the latest study.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;It takes our own research to the next level, but it is also gratifying see that Qatar was there at the start, providing our own contribution to the global knowledge of human biology and genetics,&#x201D; he said. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;It is also demonstrable proof that WCM-Q and the Qatari leadership&#x2019;s goals of transforming Qatar into a knowledge economy and a hub of world-class scientific research in the region have come to fruition. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The technology that was used in the new research &#x2013; the SOMAscan &#x2013; is available to researchers in Qatar, and with the Qatar Biobank we have a resource that is allowing researchers in the country to unlock the secrets of the human genome, and specifically the Qatari and Arabian genomes. This is a hugely valuable resource that will be used for decades to come, hopefully heralding therapies and treatments for a range of diseases and conditions that are prevalent in the MENA region.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180724%20English%20WCM-Q%20research%20underpins%20international%20effort%20to%20create%20genetic%20map%20of%20human%20proteins.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf27","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-research-supports-international-study","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-research-supports-international-study","title":"WCM-Q Research Supports International Study"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
