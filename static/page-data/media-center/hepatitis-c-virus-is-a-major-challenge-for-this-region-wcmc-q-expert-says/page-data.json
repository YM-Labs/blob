It is usually spread through the sharing of infected needles, receiving infected blood and other exposures to blood or bodily fluids. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that every year, three to four million people are newly infected with HCV. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The current situation in Egypt was ironically started as a consequence of health care campaigns conducted from the 1950s to the early 1980s against schistosomiasis (known commonly as bilharzia). Addressing Hepatitis C is one of the largest health challenges faced by this country today, and has strained its resources by dealing with a large pool of about six million chronically infected people.&#x201D; Dr Abu-Raddad said.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Abu-Raddad described how the HCV epidemic has emerged including the contextual factors surrounding its emergence. Causes of current new infections and the latest advances in scientific research on this epidemic were highlighted and the talk included a discussion of the key priorities in relation to prevention programs and scientific research. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Abu-Raddad is Associate Professor of Public Health, Principal Investigator of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, and the Director of the Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Biomathematics Research Core at WCMC-Q.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8qf77","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hepatitis-c-virus-is-a-major-challenge-for-this-region-wcmc-q-expert-says","currSlug":"/media-center/hepatitis-c-virus-is-a-major-challenge-for-this-region-wcmc-q-expert-says","title":"Hepatitis C Virus Is A Major Challenge For This Region, WCMC-Q Expert Says"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
