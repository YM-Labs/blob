It further asserts that from 2008 to 2030, cancer cases would rise by 65 percent in high-income countries, 80 percent in middle-income countries and 100 percent in the world&#x2019;s poorest countries.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/22_%2009_%2015_WISHAustralianMPsDoha_PR_EN_.pdf\"><strong>click here. </strong></a><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28qf27","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-presents-cancer-research-to-australian-policymakers","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-presents-cancer-research-to-australian-policymakers","title":"WISH Presents Cancer Research to Australian Policymakers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
