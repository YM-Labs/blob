Its aim is to equip students with the skills, insight, and impetus that will enable them to pursue rewarding and impactful careers in science and research, and add to Qatar&#x2019;s pool of homegrown talent in this field.<br>\n <br>\n More than 3,200 students from universities in Qatar have benefited from UREP over its lifespan, participating in 937 projects across 22 cycles. The top 25 percent of projects completed under the program in 2017 were selected to participate in the 10th Annual UREP Competition, with QNRF announcing the results during a ceremony held at Qatar National Convention Centre on April 5. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image_2-24.jpg\" alt=\"Image_2.JPG\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n In total, seven projects &#x2013; covering a range of areas including health; energy and environment; computing and ICT; and social sciences, arts, and humanities &#x2013; were shortlisted for the competition, with each team giving a public presentation in front of a panel of judges.
