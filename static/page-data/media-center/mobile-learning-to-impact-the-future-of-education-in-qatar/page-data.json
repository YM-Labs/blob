The research is underway in partnership with Canada&#x2019;s Athabasca University and is led by Dr Mohamed Ally from the same university.<br>\n <br>\n According to Dr Mohammad Samaka, the co-lead researcher for the &#x2018;m-learning&#x2019; project, the research, which is now in its second year, is the first of its kind to be used for professional training in Qatar and possibly the world&#x2019;s oil and gas sector. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;There is no history of mobile learning applications utilized to train employees in the work place in Qatar. This project is novel,&#x201D; said Dr Mohammad Samaka, the co-lead researcher for the &#x2018;m-learning&#x2019; project. &#x201C;During our most recent literature review, a hunt for existing applications yielded nothing, indicating that this could be the first mobile learning application under development in the oil and gas industry worldwide.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Testing of the &#x2018;m-learning&#x2019; project was conducted on a pool of around 30 Qatari trainees located at five different Qatar Petroleum (QP) sites as a supplementary element to their on-going corporate training. The application is designed to help employees familiarize themselves with technical English language terms specific to the energy sector in order to enhance their professional communication. <br>\n <br>\n &#x2018;M-learning&#x2019; uses a blended approach to deliver specialized content on mobile devices with unlimited access to the material, allowing learners to advance at their own pace and convenience.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We are not looking to replace conventional classroom teaching,&#x201D; explains Dr Samaka. &#x201C;&apos;M-learning&#x2019; complements face-to-face teaching by enhancing the educational experience through our developed interactive multimedia content, based on existing course material.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We are currently testing &#x2018;m-learning&#x2019; on QU&#x2019;s foundation level students learning English,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I am sure once it is fully developed &#x2018;m-learning&#x2019; can be deployed into other areas of society, at school or university level, due to the nature of its interchangeable and adaptable content.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/12.24.13%20QNRF%20m-learning%20feature%20ENG_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10qf25","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/mobile-learning-to-impact-the-future-of-education-in-qatar","currSlug":"/media-center/mobile-learning-to-impact-the-future-of-education-in-qatar","title":"Mobile Learning To Impact The Future Of Education In Qatar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
