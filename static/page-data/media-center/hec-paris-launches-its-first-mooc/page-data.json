Because regardless of where today&#x2019;s business executives are located, the EU not only affects lives but may also transform it. <br>\n <br>\n Thus, empowering participants with an in-depth knowledge and understanding about Europe and the European Union, how it works, why it matters and what it can offer enables participants to get a better grasp of the applicable framework for any European economic or social activity to participate on the EU stage.<br>\n <br>\n Coursera is an education company that partners with the top universities and organizations in the world to offer courses online for anyone to take, for free. Coursera&#x2019;s technology enables its partners to teach millions of students and 444 courses are available from 87 universities.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/HEC%20Paris%20MOOC%20Release%202-Eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8qf49","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hec-paris-launches-its-first-mooc","currSlug":"/media-center/hec-paris-launches-its-first-mooc","title":"HEC Paris Launches Its First MOOC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
