In the construction industry, LTI is defined as an on-site incident which results in a fatality, permanent disability or time lost from work.<br>\n <img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" alt=\"B_Aerial_View_Sunset_Tournament.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/B_Aerial_View_Sunset_Tournament.jpg\"><br>\n Commenting on this tremendous achievement, Engineer Jassim Telefat, Group Executive Director of Qatar Foundation Capital Projects and Facilities Management, said: &#x201C;At Qatar Foundation we believe that dignified living and working conditions are absolutely essential elements to unlocking human potential. In order to meet these values and principles, we are ensuring that all construction work on our projects is carried out to agreed international health and safety standards. This is a cause that we are fully committed to and one that is beginning to show real benefits for the highly-valued individuals employed on our projects.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n QF&#x2019;s health and safety achievements at its new Headquarters and Strategic Studies Center complement wider efforts by the organization to holistically improve its employees living and working conditions as part of its Migrant Worker Welfare initiative, a project that has also been alternatively named &#x2018;Karama&#x2019;, or &#x2018;dignity&#x2019; in Arabic, due to its holistic approach.<br>\n <img width=\"1024\" height=\"628\" alt=\"IMG_1922.JPG\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/IMG_1922.JPG.jpeg\"><br>\n Over the last two years Karama projects have played an very important role in improving the living standards of migrant workers in Qatar. Amongst Karama&#x2019;s most notable achievements are the Qatar Foundation Mandatory Standards for Worker Welfare. <br>\n <br>\n Published in April 2013, this 50-page, comprehensive document combines Qatari Labour Law with international best practice and is based upon a holistic and principled approach that looks to safeguard the rights of workers from the moment they are recruited until they return to their home countries.<br>\n <br>\n From January 2014 the Standards have been included in all new contracts on QF projects. Shortly after the Mandatory Standards were published, QF set up its Migrant Welfare Department (MWD) to monitor contractor adherence to the standards through regular assessments, audits and inspections.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/22_06_2015_QF%20Worker%20Welfare%20Feature%20EN.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf46","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-making-strides-in-delivering-dignity-for-all-migrant-workers","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-making-strides-in-delivering-dignity-for-all-migrant-workers","title":"Qatar Foundation: Making Strides in Delivering Dignity for All Migrant Workers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
