According to the International Diabetes Federation, Qatar has a high prevalence of the disease ranking eighth globally with a 23.3 per cent comparative prevalence rate.<br>\n<br>\nDr Philippe Froguel, QBRI’s Scientific Director of Genomic Medicine and Systems Biology Research Center, will present his latest findings at the conference showing the genetic basis of diabetes as well as the link between type 2 diabetes patients and their predisposition to develop certain kinds of cancer. Dr Froguel’s findings were recently published in international scientific journals, including Nature Genetics, and he was the first person in the world to identify the type 2 diabetes gene. <br>\n<br>\nThe Annual Research Conference will be held at the Qatar National Convention Centre on 24-25 November. <br>\nFor more information about ARC’13 please visit: <a href=\"http://www.qf-arc.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.qf-arc.org</a>. <br>\n<br>\nFor the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/11%2009%2013%20QF-ARC-QBRI%20PR_English_FINAL.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10qf91","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nobel-laureates-to-discuss-stem-cell-advancements-at-annual-research-conference","currSlug":"/media-center/nobel-laureates-to-discuss-stem-cell-advancements-at-annual-research-conference","title":"Nobel Laureates To Discuss Stem Cell Advancements At Annual Research Conference"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
