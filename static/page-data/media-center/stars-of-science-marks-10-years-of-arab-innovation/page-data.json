Its latest season will be available on multiple channels throughout the region and can be viewed with subtitles on the &#x2018;Stars of Science&#x2019; website and YouTube platform.<br>\n <br>\n The 10-episode season will introduce viewers to cutting-edge innovations and the people behind them, with the young contestants on the show sharing one mission &#x2013; to develop practical solutions to regional challenges. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Initiating a leading forum of innovation that provides Arab youth with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed has, and still is, the driving force behind Stars of Science,&#x201D; said Khalifa Essa Al Kubaisi, Media Relations Manager, QF. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%202-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2.JPG\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n &#x201C;It is our shared responsibility to support rising innovators and inspire Arab youth by connecting them with positive role models. The success of Stars of Science can be measured by the millions of young people it has encouraged to dream big, through their exposure to the show and its inspirational alumni. It has proven its substantial impact and will continue to do so in the years to come.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The casting period will see hundreds of hopefuls pitch their ideas, and, once selected, the top nine candidates - mentored by experts and Stars of Science alumni - will enter the prototyping and customer validation rounds. Eliminations based on jury feedback will take place across the following episodes, before four finalists compete to win a share of $600,000 for seed funding. <br>\n <br>\n As candidates look to advance to the Grand Finale, Stars of Science jury members, Professor Fouad Mrad, Professor Abdelhamid El-Zoheiry, and Dr. Khalid Al Ali, will provide them with constructive criticism. TV personality Khaled Al Jumaily also returns as the show&#x2019;s host.<br>\n <br>\n 131 of the show&#x2019;s alumni have raised $14 million in revenue, crowdfunding, and research grants, with many Stars of Science innovators going on to pursue their education, while almost 60 percent have started businesses and are contributing to their communities through talks and other outreach activities. <br>\n <br>\n Watch episode 1 on Saturday, September 22, on AlRayyan Satellite Channel.
