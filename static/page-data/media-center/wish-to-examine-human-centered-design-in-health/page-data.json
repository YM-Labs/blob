The research findings will be presented in a report that will be published in time for WISH 2018, and will be discussed in depth during a panel session to be held during the prestigious biennial event. The report aims to result in policy recommendations that can improve healthcare.<br>\n The WISH Design in Health research group is being led by Aaron Sklar, co-founder of Prescribe Design and VP of Brand Experience at Giant Creative Strategy in San Francisco, USA. Throughout his career, Sklar has led design teams focused on improving people&#x2019;s quality of life, health, and wellness. Qatar is represented in the research group by Dr. Dena Al-Thani, Assistant Professor, Hamad Bin Khalifa University. <br>\n <br>\n As with previous summits, WISH 2018 will once again gather the world&#x2019;s healthcare leaders at QNCC to highlight and address some of the world&#x2019;s most pressing healthcare challenges. WISH, which hosts its showcase Doha summit biennially, has firmly established itself as a major highlight on the global healthcare calendar for the thousands of high-level policy-makers, academics, and professionals in attendance. It has also become a key platform for the dissemination of healthcare innovation and best practices. <br>\n <br>\n WISH 2018 will feature nine research forums, each led by an internationally renowned expert in their field. Between them, the nine forums will highlight and address some of the world&#x2019;s most pressing challenges across topics that cover medical, ethical, technological, and humanitarian aspects of healthcare.<br>\n <br>\n WISH 2018 will also feature reports on its ongoing impact locally and globally on issues previously highlighted at the summit, such as autism, and will host an array of community-based events across Qatar. Examples of healthcare innovation in action will be on display at &#x2018;The WISH Hub,&#x2019; an enhanced interactive space that will showcase novel healthcare products, host informal discussions, and provide hands-on experience with technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_WISH_DesignHealth_PressRelease_EN_20180221.pdf\">here</a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28qf41","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-to-examine-human-centered-design-in-health","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-to-examine-human-centered-design-in-health","title":"WISH to Examine Human-Centered Design in Health"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
