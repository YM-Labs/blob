You have to come up with a diagnosis based on history and physical examination without having any modern testing modalities and this helps you to move a step higher in rationalizing your decisions and diagnoses,&#x201D; Ahmed said.<br>\n <br>\n For Lama, it was both an opportunity to observe at close range the treatment and effects of infectious diseases such as malaria and TB and other rare infectious diseases. At the same time it was an opportunity to experience the African traditions and lifestyle. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The patients are mainly poor and unable to buy medication. They rely mostly on traditional healers and herbal medicine, which is a big challenge modern medicine faces in such communities. Resources are very limited,&#x201D; Lama said.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/131023%20English%20Tanzania%20global%20health%20education%20and%20research%20program%20an%20eye%20opener%20for%20WCMC-Q%20students.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf24","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/tanzania-global-health-education-and-research-program-an-eye-opener-for-wcmc-q-students","currSlug":"/media-center/tanzania-global-health-education-and-research-program-an-eye-opener-for-wcmc-q-students","title":"Tanzania Global Health Education And Research Program An Eye Opener For WCMC-Q Students"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
