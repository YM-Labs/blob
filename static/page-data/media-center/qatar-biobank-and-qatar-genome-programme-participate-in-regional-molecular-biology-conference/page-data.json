By doing so, the Qatar Genome Programme is already offering valuable opportunities for local researchers to study various diseases within the population.<br>\n <br>\n The goal, said Dr Ismail, is to enable healthcare providers to use that genetic information to better serve their patients through preventative and curative measures. &#x201C;No more will medicine be one-size-fits-all. Instead, each genomic group will have its own approach to medical issues,&#x201D; he said.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Afifi detailed how Qatar Biobank collects samples from volunteer participants, a three-hour process with a focus on maintaining the visitors&#x2019; privacy and dignity. She also shared some findings from the study of the first 3,000 samples collected by Qatar Biobank. This pilot phase found high overweight and obesity levels, as well as a 17 per cent rate of diabetes in the adults surveyed.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_Qatar%20Biobank_MEMBS_PR_EN-2016%2011%2027.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong>.</a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf58","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-biobank-and-qatar-genome-programme-participate-in-regional-molecular-biology-conference","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-biobank-and-qatar-genome-programme-participate-in-regional-molecular-biology-conference","title":"Qatar Biobank and Qatar Genome Programme Participate in Regional Molecular Biology Conference"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
