As a think-tank that serves as a Qatar&#x2019;s primary incubator to help entrepreneurs plan, launch, and grow start-up technology companies, QSTP provides world-class infrastructure, managerial know-how, favorable regulatory terms, and comprehensive financial support. And, in doing so, the center is helping to develop the country&#x2019;s human capital and resources; key to the successful creation of a knowledge-based economy.<br>\n <img width=\"300\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/sponsors%20eng%20qstpiasp-8.jpg\" alt=\"sponsors eng qstpiasp.png\"><br>\n The importance of collaboration between individuals was reiterated by the entrepreneur ambassador, Chad Hurley, who drew upon his personal experiences on PayPal and YouTube to provide an insightful keynote speech at the opening of the conference. &#x201C;That is what technology is about, getting a lot of individuals together to try and solve a similar problem,&#x201D; he said.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Innovation is more about the journey, and the opportunity of having the chance to create something new with those individuals you work with along the way. I really hope that everyone here has a chance to surround themselves with great individuals, and a great team, that share in the same vision,&#x201D; he concluded.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/21-10-2014_QSTP%20Entrepreneurial%20Development%20Feature_Eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf30","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/iasp-conference-demonstrates-qfs-dedication-to-entrepreneurial-development-across-the-region","currSlug":"/media-center/iasp-conference-demonstrates-qfs-dedication-to-entrepreneurial-development-across-the-region","title":"IASP Conference Demonstrates QF’s Dedication to Entrepreneurial Development across the Region"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
