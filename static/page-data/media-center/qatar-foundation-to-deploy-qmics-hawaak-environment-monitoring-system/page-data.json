The information contributes to building a rich bank of data, which users can access via multiple channels, including mobiles and web portals.<br>\n <br>\n The monitoring stations will be located across main areas of QF&#x2019;s campus to provide a comprehensive overview of the environment and air quality conditions onsite. <br>\n <br>\n The distributed monitoring stations will measure the levels of O3, NO2, NO, CO, PM 2.5, and some meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed and direction. Information will be accessible for all Qatar Foundation staff members and students through Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s internal <em>Maktabi</em> web portal.<br>\n <br>\n Hawa&#x2019;ak is currently capable of monitoring electro-magnetic field radiation caused by cellular wireless towers and indoor Wi-Fi access points, and will soon support the deployment of advanced weather stations and collection of detailed weather-related data. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/23-9-2014%20QF%20Hawa&apos;ak%20PR%20En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</strong><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf21","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-to-deploy-qmics-hawaak-environment-monitoring-system","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-to-deploy-qmics-hawaak-environment-monitoring-system","title":"Qatar Foundation to Deploy QMIC’s Hawa’ak™ Environment Monitoring System"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
