Moreover, according to a World Health Organization statistic published this August, patient death occurring due to a preventable medical accident, while receiving healthcare, is estimated to be 1 in 300.</p>\n<p>“These alarming numbers emphasize the need for changing the underlying systems of care, in order to reduce the occurrence of errors. Equally important is to cultivate a non-punitive culture of safety, that rewards error reporting and transparency within an organization,” said Ms. El Akoum. </p>\n<p>“WISH’s research efforts in Qatar have shown that nurses play a critical role in ensuring patient safety through their increased interaction with both the patients as well as the care processes, allowing them to identify the inherent weaknesses in the system. Therefore, it is crucial for nurses to feel safe and empowered to speak up and for the system to reward them for doing so.</p>"}}},{"__typename":"ContentfulModuleImageGallery","id":"3bbca758-c83c-5642-8fcf-86321e655f06","images":[{"caption":null,"image":{"id":"e19b991f-0e6c-5bab-94a3-6af60e99a1b3","title":"Image2","file":{"details":{"image":{"width":2010,"height":852}}},"sizes":{"aspectRatio":1.8666666666666667,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=280&h=150&q=85 280w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=560&h=300&q=85 560w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85 1120w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=1680&h=900&q=85 1680w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=2010&h=1077&q=85 2010w","srcWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85&fm=webp","srcSetWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=280&h=150&q=85&fm=webp 280w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=560&h=300&q=85&fm=webp 560w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85&fm=webp 1120w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=1680&h=900&q=85&fm=webp 1680w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=2010&h=1077&q=85&fm=webp 2010w","sizes":"(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px"},"singleMode":{"aspectRatio":1.7906976744186047,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=1540&h=860&q=85&fit=pad","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=385&h=215&q=85&fit=pad 385w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=770&h=430&q=85&fit=pad 770w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=1540&h=860&q=85&fit=pad 1540w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=2010&h=1122&q=85&fit=pad 2010w","srcWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=1540&h=860&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad","srcSetWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=385&h=215&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad 385w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=770&h=430&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad 770w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=1540&h=860&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad 1540w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/3kYwX3Cfpr7hdXL4235sMZ/9a02b6c05406e887d634ad9ae6552872/Image2.jpg?w=2010&h=1122&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad 2010w","sizes":"(max-width: 1540px) 100vw, 1540px"}}}]}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4K3LW5K87m8NgyP0jw4JOL","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-presents-research-at-8th-international-patient-safety-conference-in","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-presents-research-at-8th-international-patient-safety-conference-in","title":"Wish Presents Research At 8th International Patient Safety Conference in India"}}}
