This seminar series, titled the Research Outcome Seminars (ROS), is administered by Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), a constituent of QF R&amp;D.<br>\n <br>\n The seminars will feature quarterly presentations by scientists from QF R&amp;D&#x2019;s research institutes as well as external research funded by QNRF. The seminar topics will focus on the four pillars of the Qatar National Research Strategy, namely energy and environment, computing and information technology, health, and social sciences and arts and humanities.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Abdul Sattar Al Taie, Executive Director of QNRF, said the seminars represent a commitment to share the findings of advanced research conducted in Qatar with both the public and the international scientific community. &#x201C;Our goal is to deliver new technologies that will support Qatar National Vision 2030 and help create a sustainable post-hydrocarbon society,&#x201D; he added. <br>\n <br>\n The seminars are designed specifically for the public to share questions and ideas with the researchers. In addition to the direct benefit of the research to Qatar, one criteria for presentations at the seminars (ROS) is the project&#x2019;s potential for commercialisation. The first seminar, conducted on 4 December 2013, featured presentations by Qatar University on the density measurements of natural gas mixtures and by Texas A&amp;M University researchers on Gas-to-Liquid technologies. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf2","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-research-and-development-launches-research-outcome-seminars","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-research-and-development-launches-research-outcome-seminars","title":"Qatar Foundation Research And Development Launches Research Outcome Seminars"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
