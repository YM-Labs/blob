It will also highlight the disparity between the vital role of the family in Arab society juxtaposed against the lack of incentive to spearhead research that could provide a foundation to guide family policy. This should address the challenges facing families in the modern day.<br>\n <br>\n The second day of the conference will focus on the role of state policies on family formation and stability. Dr David Finkelhor, Director of Crimes against Children Research Center and Professor of Sociology at the University of New Hampshire in the United States, will present the keynote address. His plenary session on &#x201C;Family Factors in Preventing Childhood Exposure to Family, Peer and Community Violence,&#x201D; will explore the characteristics of domestic and family violence in the home. By conceptualising child abuse, Dr David will emphasise the family&#x2019;s role in preventing child victimisation by highlighting influencing factors and consequences that maltreatment can cause to children. <br>\n <br>\n The selected papers by DIFI researchers will conclude the conference with one of their final presentations on &#x2018;Internally displaced families in Khartoum, Sudan: Challenges and Coping Strategies.&#x2019;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/02-05-15%20DIFI%201st%20Annual%20Conference%20on%20Family%20Research%20and%20Policy%20En.pdf\">click here</a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf89","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/doha-international-family-institute-holds-its-inaugural-annual-conference-on-family-research-and-policy","currSlug":"/media-center/doha-international-family-institute-holds-its-inaugural-annual-conference-on-family-research-and-policy","title":"Doha International Family Institute Holds Its Inaugural Annual Conference On Family Research And Policy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
