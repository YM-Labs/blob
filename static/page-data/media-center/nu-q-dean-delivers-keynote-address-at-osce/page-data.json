He also called on social media leaders to enforce ethical standards and curtail the use of unnamed sources and advertising paid by unsavory interests. <br>\n <br>\n The dean spoke before than 100 European governmental leaders, security officials, educators and other officials at a palace in Vienna&#x2019;s historic Hofburg. <br>\n <br>\n Digital and social media for all their benefits are also undermining media freedom with fake news, trolls and other efforts at disinformation that distorts the free flow of information and the media&apos;s first obligation to seek the truth. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/OSCE%20Final%20Release.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf20","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-dean-delivers-keynote-address-at-osce","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-dean-delivers-keynote-address-at-osce","title":"NU-Q Dean Delivers Keynote Address at OSCE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
