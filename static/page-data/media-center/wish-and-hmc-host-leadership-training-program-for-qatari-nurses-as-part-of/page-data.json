Other key supporters of the Nursing Now Qatar program also took part in the program, including senior nursing representatives of the Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC), Al-Ahli Hospital, the University of Calgary in Qatar (UCQ), and Sidra Medicine – a member of QF.</p>\n<p>Ms. Afdhal said: “At our most recent summit last November, nursing was selected as one of the main research topics. The WISH report on nursing noted that there was a massive shortfall in qualified nurses and midwives around the world, that nurses felt undervalued within healthcare systems, and that nurses had a significant role to play at the vanguard of efforts to deliver universal health coverage globally.</p>\n<p>“Once our summits end, we work closely with partners both in Qatar and around the world to see where the learnings from WISH can be implemented and where policy recommendations can be promoted. We are always keen to support Qatar’s efforts to build capacity and demonstrate best practice in healthcare and appreciate the willingness of leaders within Qatar’s healthcare system to work with us. We are therefore delighted to have had the opportunity to develop a program designed to help Qatari nursing leaders enhance their leadership skills.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Ryley explained how this initiative underpins national efforts to develop Qatari healthcare professionals and equip them with appropriate skills for leadership advancement.</p>\n<p>“Our local nurse leaders are passionate about strengthening the national professional identity of nursing in Qatar, and have shown immense interest in developing their skills to contribute to raising nursing and midwifery standards of care,” she said. “This is a wonderful training program for the senior group of nurses and midwives, and our collective focus is now on being proactive and putting the learning into practice to benefit our patients.”</p>\n<p>Training was delivered by Dr. Catherine Hannaway, Global Health Consultant, Nursing Now, and Professor Charlotte McArdle, Chief Nursing Officer for Northern Ireland. Local facilitators included Dr. Nabila Al-Meer, Deputy Chief of Continuing Care and Nursing Affairs, HMC; Ms. Maryam Al Mutawah, Executive Director of Nursing Rumailah Hospital, HMC; Dr. Steven Beaumont, Executive Director of Nursing, Hazm Mebaireek General Hospital, HMC; and Dr. Deborah White, Dean of UCQ.</p>\n<p>More than 40 nurses took part in workshops and other interactive activities that were chosen to help support a commitment by Qatar’s leadership to build vital capacity and sustainability across the healthcare sector. The various local partners of Nursing Now Qatar have pledged to work together to help identify areas where a unified approach to such issues as recruitment and personal development can be beneficial, and to highlight the role that nurses are playing in maintaining healthy populations.</p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6510vP36TVEqXza3nFJaKI","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-and-hmc-host-leadership-training-program-for-qatari-nurses-as-part-of","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-and-hmc-host-leadership-training-program-for-qatari-nurses-as-part-of","title":"WISH And HMC Host Leadership Training Program For Qatari Nurses as Part of Global Initiative"}}}
