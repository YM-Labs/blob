In its updated format, the NPRP is an innovation engine, assessing, developing, and building Qatar&#x2019;s capabilities to support research with the potential to make a substantial contribution to the economy. A promising indication of the strong interest shown by the commercial stakeholders, industry and government is that 57% of the proposals generated by this fresh approach are supported by a mixture of both local and international co-funding.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n During the first tier of the review process, the technical and scientific merits of each proposal are assessed by up to three international peer reviewers with strong track records in research and an appropriate mix of scientific and industrial expertise related to the theme of the proposal, generating 1,029 evaluations. A total of 200 top-quality proposals were then judged to be of sufficient merit to be shortlisted and are currently undergoing a programmatic review; the second tier of evaluation. Of those shortlisted, 40% were in the field of energy and the environment; 29% in health; 19% in information and communication technologies; and 12% in social sciences, arts, and humanities. Review panel members, who were drawn predominately from local industrial stakeholders, QF R&amp;D specialists and international experts, will now have the task of selecting the best research projects to be funded. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_QNRF_NPRP_PR_EN_20170529.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf36","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qnrf-initiative-receives-376-research-proposals","currSlug":"/media-center/qnrf-initiative-receives-376-research-proposals","title":"QNRF Initiative Receives 376 Research Proposals"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
