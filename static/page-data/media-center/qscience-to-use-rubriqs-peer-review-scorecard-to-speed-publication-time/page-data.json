Using its proprietary software, Rubriq matches and assigns submissions to the appropriate peer reviewers, who utilize the patent-pending scorecard Rubriq uses to provide standardized, structured reviews. <br>\n <br>\n Rubriq also provides journal recommendations, using the reviews and software to match submitted papers to appropriate journals by keywords, as well as the impact and quality of the papers as assessed by the reviewers.<br>\n <br>\n According to Arend Kuester, Managing Director at <em>QScience</em>, <em>QScience</em> represents an ideal partner for Rubriq&#x2019;s standardized, independent peer review scorecard as it has a reputation as an innovator that is always looking for ways to improve the publishing process.<br>\n <br>\n <em>QScience</em>&#x2019;s focus on open access is also a good fit for Rubriq. Open access has been criticized by some for its potential for conflicts of interest or lower-quality (and sometimes non-existent) peer review. <br>\n <br>\n By using a tested, standardized, and independent peer review service like Rubriq, any journal can be assured of receiving unbiased, high-quality evaluations of research. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/16_02_2014_Bloomsbury%20QScience%20%20Rubriq%20PR_Eng_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf56","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qscience-to-use-rubriqs-peer-review-scorecard-to-speed-publication-time","currSlug":"/media-center/qscience-to-use-rubriqs-peer-review-scorecard-to-speed-publication-time","title":"QScience To Use Rubriq’s Peer Review Scorecard To Speed Publication Time"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
