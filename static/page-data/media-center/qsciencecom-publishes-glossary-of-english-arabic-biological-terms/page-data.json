This understanding and expansion will contribute to the academic success of Arabic-speaking students not only in Qatar but across the Gulf region.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The glossary will be available in major national bookstores and through Amazon.com. It is also under review by Qatar&#x2019;s Supreme Education Council for its potential as a reference book for use in independent schools.<br>\n <br>\n In addition to the printed book, there is also an app version available for iOS and Android, which will allow students to search an English term on their phone or tablet and obtain the Latin and Arabic derivations for that word.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/20%2009%202015_QScience%20Glossary_PR_EN.pdf\"><strong>click here.</strong></a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf63","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qsciencecom-publishes-glossary-of-english-arabic-biological-terms","currSlug":"/media-center/qsciencecom-publishes-glossary-of-english-arabic-biological-terms","title":"QScience.com Publishes Glossary of English-Arabic Biological Terms"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
