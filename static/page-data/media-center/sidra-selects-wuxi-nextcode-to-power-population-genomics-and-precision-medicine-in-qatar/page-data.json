Its aim is to generate genome sequence and molecular &#x2019;omics data on the Qatari population and link it to a national electronic medical record (EMR) system that will help chart a road map for future advanced health care through personalized medicine. <br>\n <br>\n WuXi NextCODE&#x2019;s technology was originally developed to conduct population research in Iceland &#x2013; which is similar to the Qatar Genome Project in terms of sample size and participation. In partnership with Qatar Biobank, another key institution in the QGP, Sidra is currently aiming to complete the pilot phase by May 2016. <br>\n <br>\n A whole-genome pilot of the Qatari population with a sample size of 3,000 &#x2013; using the Wuxi NextCODE system - is already underway.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/2015_10_07%20-%20Press%20Release%20-%20Sidra%20selects%20Wuxi%20NextCode%20-%20ENG%20(QR).pdf\" target=\"_blank\">click here.</a> </strong> &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf77","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-selects-wuxi-nextcode-to-power-population-genomics-and-precision-medicine-in-qatar","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-selects-wuxi-nextcode-to-power-population-genomics-and-precision-medicine-in-qatar","title":"Sidra Selects Wuxi NextCODE to Power Population Genomics and Precision Medicine in Qatar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
