As the organization enters a new phase of sustainable development and builds on its foundation and past achievements to deliver more focused results, as part of the country&#x2019;s drive to achieve Qatar National Vision 2030, it must continue to be more efficient and beneficial to the public, and evolve the way it communicates with its audiences.<br>\n <br>\n Past and current successful programs will be revisited and celebrated over the next few months.
