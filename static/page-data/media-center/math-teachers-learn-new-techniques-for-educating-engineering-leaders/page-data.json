He reminded teachers of the significant contributions of ancient Arab scholars to science and led sessions in which he highlighted math concepts that are important for success as a university engineering student. Teachers used graphing calculators with rangefinder devices to link mathematical data with real-world applications.<br>\n <br>\n The institute was developed as part of the Engineering Leaders outreach strategy to prepare young Qataris for university studies in science, technology, engineering and math, known as STEM disciplines, said Dr Hamid Parsaei, director of academic outreach and professor of mechanical engineering at Texas A&amp;M at Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n Sheikh Faisal Al-Thani, deputy managing director of Maersk Oil Qatar, said the company is investing in teacher development among other academic initiatives to strengthen human and social development for Qatar&#x2019;s knowledge-based economy.<br>\n <br>\n &quot;As the operator of Qatar&apos;s largest and most complex offshore oilfield &#x2014; Al Shaheen &#x2014; we are committed to supporting development of the specialist workforce needed to responsibly unlock Qatar&apos;s important national resources,&#x201D; Sheikh Faisal said. &#x201C;We are therefore supporting a number of educational initiatives aimed at developing Qatar&apos;s human capital and knowledge economy; investing in teacher development and nurturing and developing interest in STEM disciplines is critical to achieving this.&quot;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The inaugural Engineering Leaders Institute is helping professional teachers to broaden their experience and skills in a range of engineering disciplines in mathematics to be able to better attract and inspire the next generation to follow a technical educational track, that can lead to successful and rewarding careers in industries like oil and gas,&#x201D; Al-Thani added.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Math%20teachers%20learn%20new%20techniques%20for%20educating%20engineering%20leaders%20English.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf98","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/math-teachers-learn-new-techniques-for-educating-engineering-leaders","currSlug":"/media-center/math-teachers-learn-new-techniques-for-educating-engineering-leaders","title":"Math Teachers Learn New Techniques for Educating Engineering Leaders"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
