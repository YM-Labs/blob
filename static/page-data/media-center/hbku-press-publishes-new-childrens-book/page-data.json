Participants were given the opportunity to exchange ideas, discuss the problems and challenges of writing for children, and develop their story lines and book projects with Krause in a friendly and supportive environment. <br>\n <br>\n In a subsequent workshop of the &#x2018;Books - Made in Qatar&apos; project, ten illustrators were invited to illustrate the texts that were created in the writers&#x2019; workshop. The workshop was once again led by Krause and explored the importance of the visual elements in relation to the texts. Krause personally assigned each illustrator to a story based on what she thought would work well with their individual style.<br>\n <br>\n The final books which were created as a result of both workshops were then pitched to the editorial team at HBKU Press. Each publication was reviewed based on the criteria of clarity, creativity and originality of the content, and how well it aligned with the illustrations.<br>\n <br>\n Ashgar Al Hawaa will be launched to the public at the 28th Doha International Book Fair on November 29th, 2017.
