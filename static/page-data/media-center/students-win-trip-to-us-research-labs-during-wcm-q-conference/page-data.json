Schools across Qatar were given the chance to participate in a student research contest based on the UN&#x2019;s Sustainable Development Goals. Twenty-five teams from both independent and private schools entered and chose a topic under one of three following themes: Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages; ensuring access to water and sanitation for all; making cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable; and ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns.<br>\n <br>\n They then took part in a poster presentations competition last March. Fourteen teams made it through to the finals at the High School Medical Conference with the top three then selected by a panel of WCM-Q research experts. The winning team from Qatar International School received a fully-funded, one-week trip to WCM-Q&#x2019;s parent campus in Ithaca in the United States, while the runners-up - 2nd placed Bright Future International School received iPads and invitations to attend a research symposium at Sidra Medicine, and 3rd placed Musab Bin Omair Secondary School &#x2013; received gift vouchers and were also invited to the Sidra Medicine event. The flights were provided for by Sahtak Awalan &#x2013; Your Health First, WCM-Q&#x2019;s health campaign.<br>\n <br>\n In addition to the presentations, the student delegates also heard from Fawziya Al-Khater, assistant undersecretary for educational affairs at the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, Dr. Marco Ameduri, associate dean for pre-medical education at WCM-Q, and three WCM-Q alumni: Dr. Aisha Al-Yousuf, Dr. Khalid Al-Khelaifi, and Dr. Karima Becetti.<br>\n Although the main focus of the conference is raising awareness about the careers that medicine has to offer, science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) will remain a fundamental core that will enhance and support the national economy. <br>\n <br>\n The conference presents a great platform to engage educators across these various disciplines to achieve an integrated approach for students and prepare them for the future. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/171113-20English-20Students-20win-20trip-20to-20US-20research-20labs-20after-20attending-20ins...(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf47","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/students-win-trip-to-us-research-labs-during-wcm-q-conference","currSlug":"/media-center/students-win-trip-to-us-research-labs-during-wcm-q-conference","title":"Students Win trip to US Research Labs During WCM-Q Conference"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
