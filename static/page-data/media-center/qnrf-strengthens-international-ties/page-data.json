Dr Khalid Al-Quradaghi, QNRF&#x2019;s Director of Programs, joined Dr Al-Taie and Dr Tag at the workshop to share best practices and opportunities for collaboration with researchers and policymakers in attendance from countries across Europe. The workshop concluded with a roundtable on how best to unite efforts to address global challenges in resource scarcity and health. <br>\n <br>\n In subsequent one-on-one engagements, QNRF discussed specific opportunities for collaboration with Ireland&#x2019;s leading organisations for research and innovation, including Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland. <br>\n <br>\n Two universities in Ireland are already collaborating on QNRF research grants under the NPRP model for international research engagement, which allows for up to 35 percent of overall funding to be spent outside of Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QNRF%20UK-Ireland%20visit_dr5%20QNRF%20approved.pdf\">For the full story, please click here.</a><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf44","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qnrf-strengthens-international-ties","currSlug":"/media-center/qnrf-strengthens-international-ties","title":"QNRF Strengthens International Ties"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
