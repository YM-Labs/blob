Symptoms include difficulty walking, vision problems, fatigue, pain and cognitive changes. <br>\n <br>\n MS is difficult to monitor as each patient is affected in different ways and experience different rates of disease progression. Additionally, the most widely used monitoring technique, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans of the brain, cannot accurately identify nerve damage, which is the underlying pathology associated with progressive neurological deficits. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/161019%20English%20WCM-Q%20researcher%20has%20new%20MS%20test%20in%20his%20sights.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf28","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-researcher-wins-international-funding","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-researcher-wins-international-funding","title":"WCM-Q Researcher Wins International Funding"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
