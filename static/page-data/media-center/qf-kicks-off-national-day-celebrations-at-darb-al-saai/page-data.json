We are proud to be part of this great nation, and we believe this celebration demonstrates our commitment to supporting Qatar on its journey to becoming a diversified and sustainable economy.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image2%20(15)-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n &#x201C;Another key component of our tent this year is the QF timeline. Through a variety of immersive activities, such as the &#x2018;QF Globe&#x2019;, we want to show the history of QF, its achievements, success stories, and momentous milestones, across its four core mission areas of Pre-University Education, Higher Education, Science and Research, and Community Development.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image3%20(7)-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image3 (7).jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n &#x201C;With this in mind, we would like to encourage members of the public to visit our tent to learn more about QF and its role in the community,&#x201D; Al Kubaisi concluded. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image4%20(1)-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image4 (1).jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n A number of QF centers and partner universities are also set to host activities at the QF tent. Some of these include: Qatar Career Development Center, where children can learn about different jobs and professions; Hamad Bin Khalifa University Press, where visitors can make their own books; and Georgetown University in Qatar, which will offer guests the chance to assemble a giant jigsaw puzzle in the shape of Qatar, as well as participate in an educational world map activity. <br>\n <br>\n Abdulla Al-Sulaiti, a visitor to the tent, said: &#x201C;I come to Darb Al-Saai every year to celebrate Qatar National Day with my family. We always visit Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s tent first because we like the variety of activities here, which are very thoughtfully created for people of all ages. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Today my son looked at the inside of his mouth through a microscope during the &#x2018;seeing is believing&#x2019; activity, and he was very excited about it. Activities like this are very important to encourage learning in children from a very early age.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The QF tent at Darb Al-Saai will run from December 9-20. It will be open from 8am-12pm and 4pm-10pm, Saturday - Thursday, while on Fridays it will open from 2pm. The evening of December 13 will be for ladies only.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17qf48","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qf-kicks-off-national-day-celebrations-at-darb-al-saai","currSlug":"/media-center/qf-kicks-off-national-day-celebrations-at-darb-al-saai","title":"QF Kicks Off National Day Celebrations at Darb Al-Saai"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
