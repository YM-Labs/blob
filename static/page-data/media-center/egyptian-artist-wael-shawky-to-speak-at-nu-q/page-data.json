The discussion of how culture and politics can be framed using art and various mediums will be a unique learning experience for the entire NU-Q community,&#x201D; said Everette E. Dennis, dean and CEO of NU-Q.<br>\n <br>\n Shawky is in residence at the Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art, which is located in Education City and led by HH Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. Mathaf is part of Qatar Museums, led by H.E. Sheikha al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. <br>\n <br>\n The work that brought him international recognition was Cabaret Crusades, a film using puppets that act out the medieval struggle for control over the Middle East. The Financial Times called it &#x201C;a spine-tingling anti-epic, (that) leaves viewers appalled by the carnage yet riveted by Shawky&#x2019;s meticulous mapping of the era&#x2019;s Byzantine twists and turns.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Shawky was born and educated in Alexandria, Egypt where he continues to live. His practice, spanning video, drawing, and performance, are in-depth productions about the way history and mythology are written, offering crucial perspectives on contemporary narratives of uncertainty and change. <br>\n </div>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Shawky%20Lecture%20press%20release_EV%20final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a><br>\n <br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf23","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/egyptian-artist-wael-shawky-to-speak-at-nu-q","currSlug":"/media-center/egyptian-artist-wael-shawky-to-speak-at-nu-q","title":"Egyptian Artist, Wael Shawky, to Speak at NU-Q"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
