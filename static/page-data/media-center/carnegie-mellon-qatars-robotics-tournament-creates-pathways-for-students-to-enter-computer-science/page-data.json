The theme promotes the idea that robots can work with humans to help them with daily activities.<br>\n <br>\n As part of the competition, a robot called &#x2018;Botguy&#x2019; required physical therapy to help re-acclimate to Earth&#x2019;s gravity. <br>\n <br>\n Participants developed experimental autonomous robot technologies to demonstrate various activities needed for Botguy to re-acclimatize and improve his range of motion. The goal was to show students how robotics technologies, physics and mathematical concepts are used to get assistive robots to perform &#x201C;activities of daily living.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Mohammed Mustafa, technical advisor of Botball in the Middle East, said: &#x201C;With Botball, we try to change their perceptions and explain that robots are everywhere; cruise control on your car, Google, these are all robots. We try to open their eyes at an early age. Year after year we hope Botball&#x2019;s message will spread throughout the community,&#x201D;.<br>\n <br>\n The team from DPS-Modern Indian School took home the first place prize: a chance to compete at the International Botball Tournament at the 2014 Global Conference on Educational Robotics (GCER) at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles during July this year.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/06-04-14%20Botball%20PR%20ENG%20FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2qf68","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/carnegie-mellon-qatars-robotics-tournament-creates-pathways-for-students-to-enter-computer-science","currSlug":"/media-center/carnegie-mellon-qatars-robotics-tournament-creates-pathways-for-students-to-enter-computer-science","title":"Carnegie Mellon Qatar’s Robotics Tournament Creates Pathways for Students to Enter Computer Science"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
