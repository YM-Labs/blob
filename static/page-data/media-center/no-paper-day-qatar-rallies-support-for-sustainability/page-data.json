The campaign was held from April 2 &#x2013; 6 in Qatar to engage the wider community in environmentally-friendly practices and raise awareness about the importance of sustainability. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%201-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"346\" width=\"640\"><br>\n As part of the campaign, businesses and individuals endeavored to collect recyclable waste such as newspapers and magazines, office paper, cardboard, plastic bottles, plastic cups and jugs, and aluminium and steel cans. The campaign also called on members of the community to donate old clothes and toys in a drive to help those living in less privileged conditions. <br>\n Campaign partners Global Metals and Al-Suwaidi Paper Factory, handled and processed the collected waste within their factories. Another partner, Qatar Charity, managed the donation aspect of the campaign. <br>\n <br>\n Addressing the closing ceremony of the campaign, Engineer Meshal Al Shamari, Director, QGBC, said: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s encouraging to see such far-reaching participation from Qatar&#x2019;s government and private sectors. It&#x2019;s indicative of the very fact that creating sustainable communities can only be achieved through partnerships and the active role of the country&#x2019;s public and private sector, which is the backbone of the national economy. The wide-ranging support and enthusiasm exhibited by the fifty or so businesses and institutions over the past week is encouraging for us to take bolder steps towards tackling the sustainability issues we face today, especially waste management in the country.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Coming from the hospitality, retail, construction and real-estate, education, sports, entrepreneurship, NGO and technology sectors in Qatar, the active role of participating companies was recognized in an appreciation event held at the QGBC Villa last week. <br>\n <br>\n Sheikh Soud Al Thani, Head of Sustainability of ASTAD Project Management, a participant of this year&#x2019;s campaign, said: &#x201C;This is the second year that we are taking part in this campaign. It is an ideal opportunity for all of us at ASTAD to reflect on our operations, measure the various types of waste generated in-house and find effective ways to either reduce, or recycle. We would like to make sure the messages received through the campaign are highlighted among members of our team throughout the year to ensure the impact is further maximized.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_QGBC_No%20Paper%20Day%20Closing_PressRelease_En%2020170410.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf6","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/no-paper-day-qatar-rallies-support-for-sustainability","currSlug":"/media-center/no-paper-day-qatar-rallies-support-for-sustainability","title":"‘No Paper Day Qatar’ Rallies Support for Sustainability"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
