The school is the international branch campus of VCUarts, a top-tier arts and design school in the United States.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/VCUartsQatar-20th-lockup-final-01%20(3)-17.jpg\" alt=\"VCUartsQatar-20th-lockup-final-01 (3).png\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\"><br>\n As part of the 20th anniversary, VCUQatar will henceforth be known as VCUarts Qatar, reflecting a brand alignment and new logo based on the main campus&apos;s identity. This change, which includes changing VCUQatar&apos;s logo to VCUarts Qatar, will now reflect the full name of the branch campus: Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n According to VCUarts Qatar&apos;s Executive Director of Communications, Hallema Sharif, designing a brand mark to work seamlessly across all digital platforms, while preserving its heritage, was key to the overall effort that also includes one of the most comprehensive brand systems ever introduced to the VCUarts family. <br>\n <br>\n The brand alignment demonstrates the university&#x2019;s commitment to fostering a global arts community, exemplified by establishing the campus in 1998 and offering fully accredited American art and design degrees in an international context.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;VCUarts and VCUarts Qatar&#x2019;s brand alignment is a tangible, visible expression of our commitment to art and design in Qatar and beyond, and to remain steadfast in our goals to empower our students to become leading artists and designers who will preserve culture while creating the innovation that will drive Qatar towards its goals,&#x201D; said Akel I. Kahera, PhD, VCUarts Qatar&#x2019;s Dean.<br>\n <br>\n VCU was the first U.S. university in Education City, followed by other prestigious U.S. institutions.
