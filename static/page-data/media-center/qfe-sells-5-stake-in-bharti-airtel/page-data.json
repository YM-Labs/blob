The sale was made through its Asia-Pacific regional holding company Three Pillars Pte Ltd (TPPL). The block trade was priced at INR 481 per share, a discount of 6.4% to the previous closing price as of November 7, 2017. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image1%20(19)-24.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n In May 2013, TPPL invested INR 68 billion in Bharti Airtel to strengthen the capital structure and allow further investment for growth. The investment saw TPPL acquire 199,870,006 shares at a price of INR 340 per share. Given the sale price of INR 481 per share, the sale of this stake realized a significant gain for TPPL. <br>\n <br>\n The proceeds of the share sale will be reinvested as part of the QFE Group&#x2019;s ongoing global portfolio growth and diversification, as it seeks to generate long-term financial returns by investing across a range of asset-classes, industries, and geographies. <br>\n <br>\n TPPL&#x2019;s representative on Bharti Airtel&#x2019;s Board of Directors stepped down immediately post settlement of the sale.<br>\n <br>\n Commenting on the transaction, Rashid Al-Naimi, Chief Executive Officer, QFE, said: &#x201C;We are delighted to have partnered with Bharti Airtel though an important stage of their growth. Bharti Airtel has successfully maintained its market-leading position, and its positive momentum has led to our investment performing well. The QFE Group will reinvest the proceeds globally, as we continue to grow and diversify our portfolio. We remain firm supporters of the Bharti Airtel business, the management team, and their strategy, and wish them well in the future.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n UBS acted as sole bookrunner on this transaction.<br>\n <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf33","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qfe-sells-5-stake-in-bharti-airtel","currSlug":"/media-center/qfe-sells-5-stake-in-bharti-airtel","title":"QFE Sells 5% Stake in Bharti Airtel"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
