The aim is to build human capacity in scientific research in line with Qatar National Vision 2030.<br>\n <br>\n This year six interns have been accepted onto the program, the highest number so far. <br>\n <br>\n The research training program is a unique opportunity for Qatari college graduates with an interest in biomedical research to gain hands on experience.<br>\n <br>\n Although the program is aimed at recent graduates who are interested in pursuing a career as a bench scientist, clinician or biomedical researcher, graduates are also accepted who have non-science degrees that can be used in the field of research administration.<br>\n <br>\n Applications for next year&#x2019;s program will be accepted in Fall 2014, with specific dates to be announced on the following webpage by September: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/research/programs/program3.html\">http://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/research/programs/program3.html</a><br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/140212%20English%20Creating%20the%20next%20generation%20of%20scientists%20at%20WCMC-Q.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf35","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/creating-the-next-generation-of-scientists-at-wcmc-q","currSlug":"/media-center/creating-the-next-generation-of-scientists-at-wcmc-q","title":"Creating The Next Generation Of Scientists At WCMC-Q"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
