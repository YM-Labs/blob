Similar to QGBC, its members include consultants, contractors and managers from a wide range of backgrounds, some of which include building regulation, research, education and sustainability.</p>\n <p>With 48,000 certified members worldwide, the CIOB&apos;s strategy in the Middle East includes close collaboration with universities that offer degrees in construction management, governmental organizations and leading construction companies. The institute is also devoted to sustainable building, having instigated a number of impressive green initiatives in recent years.</p>\n <p>Its Carbon Action 2050 project, for example, was launched in 2011 and is a free online tool that provides guidance on every facet of a building&#x2019;s life cycle and ways to reduce energy use.</p>\n <p>The CIOB also strictly adheres to the Global Reporting Initiative, a project that develops applicable sustainability guidelines, to manage its own carbon emissions. Hundreds of the institute&#x2019;s members have followed suit, and qualified for its &#x2018;Chartered Environmentalist&#x2019; award by demonstrating competency in the field of sustainability.</p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf59","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qgbc-in-construction-mou-with-uks-ciob","currSlug":"/media-center/qgbc-in-construction-mou-with-uks-ciob","title":"QGBC in Construction MoU With UK’s CIOB"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
