Its members will have access to field-test technological data and advanced industrial laboratory capabilities, to conduct research for the development of the industry. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Bermudez said: &#x201C;One of QEERI&#x2019;s primary goals is to assist in overcoming Qatar&#x2019;s Grand Challenges in relation to energy security.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We believe that by bringing together stakeholders, researchers, industry players, and authorities onto a common platform, under the strong leadership of QEERI with a view to the Institute&#x2019;s strong indoor testing capabilities and powerful characterization competences, we will be able to address these challenges and work towards our shared goals most efficiently.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Sheikh Mishal Jabor Al Thani added: &#x201C;Qatar is well on its path to diversifying its energy mix, which will in turn have a positive impact on the country&#x2019;s economy. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;In coming days, it is institutes like QEERI and its newly-launched Solar Consortium who will play a key role in providing the scientific research and development data we need to fuel the engines of our economy with renewable and sustainable energy. We are confident that the expertise and commitment of QEERI&#x2019;s scientists to innovation will help guide future policy-making as well as accelerate the country&#x2019;s capability for the large-scale deployment of solar power, allowing us to preserve our environment and natural resources for future generations.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180807%20-%20QEERI%20Solar%20Consortium%20-%20EN.pdf\">here</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17qf6","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qeeri-solar-consortium-to-drive-clean-energy-tech","currSlug":"/media-center/qeeri-solar-consortium-to-drive-clean-energy-tech","title":"QEERI Solar Consortium to Drive Clean Energy Tech"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
