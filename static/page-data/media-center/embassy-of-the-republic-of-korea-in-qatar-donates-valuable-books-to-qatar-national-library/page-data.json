The visit was part of the Korean Embassy&#x2019;s efforts to promote cultural relations with Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n The donated books cover a wide range of knowledge fields and include books such as &#x2018;A Concise History of Modern Korea from the Late Nineteenth Century to 2010&#x2019; and &#x2018;Masterpieces of Korean Art&#x2019;, as well as other books by the most important Korean writers and men-of-letters of different historical eras. <br>\n <br>\n Among the donated books is a replica of &#x2018;Jikji,&#x2019; which was the first in the world to be printed using movable metal types in July 1377. The donated books also reflect different sources of knowledge and information in a variety of fields such as literature, history, and arts. <br>\n <br>\n Speaking about the donation, His Excellency Mr Chung Keejong, the Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Qatar, said: &#x201C;All the books donated are important, especially the replica of &#x2018;Jikji,&#x2019; also known as &#x2018;Buljo Jikji simche yojeol,&#x2019; a Korean document, printed during the Goryeo Dynasty in 1377, it is the world&apos;s oldest existing book that was printed with movable metal type. <br>\n <br>\n The book was accepted as UNESCO World Record Inheritance and was recorded as a &#x2019;Memory of the World&#x2018; for its outstanding value on 4 September 2001. The donation of these books will hopefully provide a chance to introduce the Korean culture to Qatari citizens and help enhance their understanding of Korea.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n QNL&#x2019;s Heritage Collection Building is open to the public for tours every Sunday and Tuesday from 10.00am - 11.30am.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/01_02_2014_QNL%20Korean%20Embassy%20PR_English_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</strong><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf25","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/embassy-of-the-republic-of-korea-in-qatar-donates-valuable-books-to-qatar-national-library","currSlug":"/media-center/embassy-of-the-republic-of-korea-in-qatar-donates-valuable-books-to-qatar-national-library","title":"Embassy Of The Republic Of Korea In Qatar Donates Valuable Books To Qatar National Library"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
