These students were invited, along with their families to a closing event at WCM-Q where they received certificates marking their participation in, or completion of, the program. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Rachid Bendriss, Assistant Dean for Student Recruitment, Outreach and Foundation Programs, said: &#x201C;QADP is an excellent way for high school students with ambitions to become doctors to begin to acquire a solid foundation of skills that will help them to do so. It challenges students to be self-disciplined and pro-active, and I&#x2019;m pleased to say that this year&#x2019;s cohort rose to that challenge extremely well. We look forward to receiving applications to join WCM-Q from a great many of them.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The program, now in its fourth year, also helps students prepare for the ACT college admissions test, as well as helping them acquire important time-management and critical-thinking skills. <br>\n <br>\n The QADP course comprises a combination of face-to-face instruction, online modules and hands-on training based on a customized timetable that takes account of students&#x2019; high school studies. QADP is self-paced, flexible and involves a full academic year of contact from September to April. Students also have the opportunity to engage directly with WCM-Q faculty, staff and students, and to use WCM-Q facilities, giving them an accurate idea of what life as a medical student at WCM-Q would be like. <br>\n <br>\n Of the 28 students who participated, five students were awarded certificates for completion with honors in the Physical Sciences, Research Skills or Biology. One student &#x2013; Latifa Mahmoud of Al Bayan Secondary School for Girls &#x2013; was awarded a certificate of completion with honors in all modules of the program. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo2(1)-24.jpg\" alt=\"Photo2(1).jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Speaking at the closing event, Latifa said: &#x201C;The great thing about being a QADP student is that you don&#x2019;t just get to enhance your skills academically, you also get amazing advice and tips about the college application process and access to WCM-Q resources, like you were a true Cornell student. I feel I am a much stronger student now.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Admission to the QADP is based solely on merit. Students who wish to participate must have excellent academic high school performance, have demonstrated a strong desire to become a doctor and be nominated by their high schools. <br>\n <br>\n Information about the QADP is available at WCM-Q&#x2019;s Office of Student Recruitment and Outreach at <a href=\"http://www.qatar-weill.cornell.edu/future-students\">www.qatar-weill.cornell.edu/future-students</a><br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf18","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-program-prepares-high-school-students","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-program-prepares-high-school-students","title":"WCM-Q Program Prepares High School Students"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
