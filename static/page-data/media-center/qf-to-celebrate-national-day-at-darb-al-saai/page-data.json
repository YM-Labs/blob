It&#x2019;s an opportunity for us, as a nation, to come together as one, to reflect on our accomplishments, the challenges we&#x2019;ve had to overcome, and, most importantly, look ahead to the future. Indeed, this year, Qatar&#x2019;s celebrations serve as a tangible demonstration of the values and the morals that define us as a nation.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Our various activities at Darb Al-Saai, which are represented by QF&#x2019;s four core mission areas &#x2013; Pre-University Education, Higher Education, Science and Research, and Community Development &#x2013; demonstrate our ongoing dedication to supporting the development of Qatar, as well as our belief in this country&#x2019;s great leaders and their vision for the future,&#x201D; Mrs. Zebeib concluded. <br>\n <br>\n A number of QF centers and partner universities are also set to host activities at the QF tent.
