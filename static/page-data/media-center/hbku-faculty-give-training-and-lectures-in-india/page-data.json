The agreement outlines cooperation on graduate-level education to promote knowledge on the intellectual, scientific, research, and sociocultural contributions of Islam. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/IMAGE2-17.jpg\" alt=\"IMAGE2.jpeg\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n Dr. El Gammal said: &#x201C;The impact of the MoU cannot be underestimated; these are the means by which CIS plays an instrumental role in creating impact in Islamic studies education outside its own geographical borders. With the agreement with Al Jamiya Al Islamiya, CIS will continue to support the development of Islamic education in a state that has such a rich and vast Muslim community.&#x201D; <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/IMAGE3-17.jpg\" alt=\"IMAGE3.jpeg\" height=\"311\" width=\"640\"><br>\n Both professors were also invited to the institution&#x2019;s conference on &#x2018;Building the World in the Light of Qur&#x2019;an&#x2019;, which focused on developing and addressing the challenges of modern civilizations using Qur&#x2019;anic teachings and principles. Dr. Benlahcene was recognized as a guest of honor and delivered the inaugurating speech at the conference, as well as his paper on &#x2018;The Role of Religion on Achieving Social Development&#x2019;. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/IMAGE4-17.jpg\" alt=\"IMAGE4.JPG\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n In addition to the series of lectures and the conference, CIS professors offered consultations to the institutional leadership and faculty based on the CIS experience and curriculum, and the college&#x2019;s unique interdisciplinary approach to the delivery of Islamic education. These consultations centered on how Al Jamiya Al Islamiya can better develop and deliver its Islamic studies programs, with a special focus on a new master&#x2019;s program to be added to its Islamic studies portfolio. &#x201C;These consultations form the seeds of developing strongly founded academic standards in the field of Islamic studies for the sake of Islam, Muslims, and humanity at large,&#x201D; said Dr. Badrane.&#xA0;<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CISALJAM_ENG_PRL_FINAL.pdf\">here</a><br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf47","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-faculty-give-training-and-lectures-in-india","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-faculty-give-training-and-lectures-in-india","title":"HBKU Faculty Give Training and Lectures in India"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
