The challenging work placement, which took place in TEG&#x2019;s offices in New York City from 10 &#x2013; 30 August, was designed to give students hands-on experience with one of the world&#x2019;s leading media groups.<br>\n <br>\n Maha Al-Meer from Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, and Asmaa Fikree, Fahad Alkhater, and Natalie Diong from Georgetown University &#x2013; School of Foreign Service in Qatar (SFS-Qatar), were chosen from among hundreds of university applicants for their outstanding ability to &#x2019;think outside the box&#x2018; and to present a project in an engaging and analytical format.<br>\n <br>\n With the assistance of TEG&#x2019;s event programming division, the interns benefitted from a comprehensive program that enabled them to get involved in all aspects of events management. They were offered the valuable opportunity to design a professional conference using techniques implemented in TEG&#x2019;s divisions. They were also required to assist on a variety of tasks, including the creation of event agendas, speaker selection, research, and social media activities.<br>\n <br>\n Tariq Al Sada, Corporate &amp; PR Manager at Qatar Foundation, commended the students and urged them to continue working hard and learning outside the classroom. <br>\n <br>\n He said, &#x201C;Our productive relationship with The Economist Group highlights just how powerful and valuable partnerships can be in developing the potential of youth and making a real difference in their overall education. Through this practical learning experience and interactions with experts in the field of media and event management, we are confident that our students will continue to engage and play an important role in the transfer of knowledge.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To research and develop their own ideas, the four interns collaborated with professionals working in areas such as operations, programming, marketing, and sales. The interns were also taken on site visits to give them the chance to select potential New York venues for their project.<br>\n <br>\n In addition to being exposed to all aspects of the business, project participants also learned about The Economist by speaking with editors, brand managers, creative directors, bureau chiefs, and representatives from The Economist Intelligence Unit. Through these meetings, students were able to gain useful insight into the publishing and media industry.<br>\n <br>\n <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QF%20Economist%20end%20of%20internship%20programme_En.pdf\"> For the full story, please click here.</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf52","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-hails-success-of-student-internship-program-with-the-economist-group","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-hails-success-of-student-internship-program-with-the-economist-group","title":"Qatar Foundation Hails Success Of Student Internship Program With The Economist Group"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
