delighted with Career Village’s continued success, and are pleased with the meaningful outputs that these comprehensive, useful, and enjoyable events produce. QCDC places strong emphasis on promoting a culture of career planning among youth without putting any kind of psychological pressure on students. Rather, we must provide youth with all the tools to help them choose the most appropriate career paths in line with their qualifications and ambitions, in a favorable atmosphere that ensures their future success and contribute to the nation’s prosperity.\"</p>\n<p>On the sidelines of the event, Nama launched its ‘Tamakkan’ campaign, an initiative designed to raise awareness among the youth of the importance of career development in line with the needs of the Qatari job market, drawing on the expertise of experienced professionals and retirees to equip young people with the skills to contribute to their community.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Amal A. Al-Mannai, CEO of Qatar Foundation for Social Work and Acting Executive Director of Nama, said she was pleased with the center’s participation in Career Village, noting that Nama’s participation has enabled social entrepreneurs and members of Tamakkan’s campaign to connect with school and university.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Al-Mannai added that Nama not only succeeded in educating youth on how to benefit from the project while raising awareness of the importance of professional development, but has also set examples of how hard-working youth can identify the needs of the community and contribute to its development. </p>\n<p>The event brought together representatives from 35 leading Qatar-based organizations and institutions from numerous industries including education, business and finance, energy and manufacturing, communication and transportation, health, security, media, and culture.</p>\n<p>Entities included the Ministry of Administrative Development, Labor and Social Affairs - Institute of Public Administration; the Ministry of Interior - Human Resources Department, General Directorate of Civil Defense, Traffic Department, General Directorate of Coasts and Borders Security, and Police College - Hamad Medical Corporation; and Qatar Airways.</p>\n<p>Noora Ali Al-Kuwari, Qatar University Student Enrollment Development Specialist, said: “The purpose of our participation is to attract students to the new College of Dentistry that we recently inaugurated. We have noticed a lot of interest from students in this specialization, and we have provided them with the admission guidelines. Through our participation, we aim to support Qatari secondary school students who seek to join science programs by familiarizing them with the admission requirements because these specialties are of great importance to the future of Qatar.”</p>\n<p>Students met with representatives of participating institutions and universities to inquire about job opportunities and took part in interactive activities that provided insight into various professions.</p>\n<p>Sheikha Saeed Al Nuaimi, a student at Al Maha Academy for Girls, said: “During my visit, I was able to learn in a relatively short time about the large number of academic and career opportunities available in Qatar. I also learned about the scholarship and training opportunities offered by various institutions in the country, which made me reconsider the academic track I want to pursue.”</p>\n<p>The event also featured a caricature exhibition organized by Nama to highlight the challenges faced by youth when it comes to professional development.</p>"}}},{"__typename":"ContentfulModuleImageGallery","id":"0f638464-0b93-558d-b7af-f5811e1eef47","images":[{"caption":null,"image":{"id":"706df228-e4b4-5f3f-bd1b-bbe7227ac41d","title":"2","file":{"details":{"image":{"width":1500,"height":999}}},"sizes":{"aspectRatio":1.8666666666666667,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=280&h=150&q=85 280w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=560&h=300&q=85 560w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85 1120w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=1500&h=804&q=85 1500w","srcWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85&fm=webp","srcSetWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=280&h=150&q=85&fm=webp 280w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=560&h=300&q=85&fm=webp 560w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85&fm=webp 1120w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=1500&h=804&q=85&fm=webp 1500w","sizes":"(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px"},"singleMode":{"aspectRatio":1.7906976744186047,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=1540&h=860&q=85&fit=pad","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=385&h=215&q=85&fit=pad 385w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=770&h=430&q=85&fit=pad 770w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=1500&h=838&q=85&fit=pad 1500w","srcWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=1540&h=860&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad","srcSetWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=385&h=215&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad 385w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=770&h=430&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad 770w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/2rSbe971xqZS4pyJNY2D6P/c9a21760b4b5d8c986a47a972b70ced7/2.jpg?w=1500&h=838&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad 1500w","sizes":"(max-width: 1540px) 100vw, 1540px"}}}]}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"44gfzOJCWTwoGA6kh77za1","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qcdcs-career-village-attracts-more-than-4-000-visitors","currSlug":"/media-center/qcdcs-career-village-attracts-more-than-4-000-visitors","title":"QCDC’S Career Village Attracts More Than 4,000 Visitors "}}}
