These topics have been identified by the European Commission as key priorities for 2016. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%201.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"1200\" width=\"2048\"><br>\n Aiming to inspire an informed dialogue, the event brought together an audience of 30 key European policymakers and industry and civil society representatives. Participants shared their views on entrepreneurship education in Europe, and their experiences of initiatives designed to create a sustainable environment for entrepreneurs to thrive and grow. <br>\n <br>\n Speakers included Stavros N. Yiannouka, CEO of WISE; Rodrigo Ballester, Member of the EU Commissioner&#x2019;s Cabinet on Education, Culture, Youth, and Sport; Antonio Garcia del Riego, Managing Director for European Corporate Affairs at Banco Santander; and Tomi Alakoski, Executive Director and Co-Founder of Me &amp; My City, one of the WISE Awards winning projects in 2014. The Finland-based initiative uses a 500-square meter miniature town to engage young students in basic social, civic and economic concepts. <br>\n <br>\n The event produced several conclusions relevant to policymaking, which the speakers are expected to share with their respective collaborators and audiences through their work, given the growing interest in adjusting education to the needs of the labor market in Europe. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/05%2004%2016_WISE%20Brussels_PR_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n &#xA0;</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf58","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-organizes-high-level-dialogue-on-entrepreneurship-in-brussels","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-organizes-high-level-dialogue-on-entrepreneurship-in-brussels","title":"WISE Organizes High-Level Dialogue on Entrepreneurship in Brussels"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
