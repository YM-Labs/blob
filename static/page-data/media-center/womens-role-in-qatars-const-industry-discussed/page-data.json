Rasha Al-Sulaiti, Vice Chair of QGBC and Project Management Director at Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s Capital Projects and Facilities Management division &#x2013; where the ratio of Qatari women versus men now stands at 52 percent to 48 percent respectively. <br>\n <br>\n At the national level the picture is very different. According to Qatar Statistics Authority&#x2019;s recent survey of the nearly half a million people working in the construction sector, only 2,800 are women, including just 143 Qataris. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;When you enter a construction company (in Qatar)&#x2026; you hardly find a woman, except in administrative tasks,&#x201D; said Sheikha Athba bint Thamer Al Thani, who, since joining QDVC in 2010, has advanced to become Chief Support Services and Sustainable Development Manager. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I want to highlight why we experience this situation and how we can convince both men and women that females have a role to play in an industry representing billions of Qatari Riyals,&#x201D; said Ms Al Thani, before drawing attention to cultural limitations, long working hours, and a variety of other restrictions hindering the potential of women in sustainable development. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28qf59","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/womens-role-in-qatars-const-industry-discussed","currSlug":"/media-center/womens-role-in-qatars-const-industry-discussed","title":"Women’s Role in Qatar’s Const.
