The panel, which will take place during the 2015 Summit, will focus on the development and implementation of &#x2018;Genomic Medicine&#x2019; and the innovation and ethical challenges behind this revolutionary new medicine. <br>\n <br>\n Although Genomic Medicine raises complex ethical and religious issues, the potential it holds for future healthcare is immense. This is why &#x2018;Genomic Medicine&#x2019; is currently one of Qatar&#x2019;s national priorities and Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Chairperson of Qatar Foundation and Founder of WISH, announced the &#x2018;Qatar Genome Project&#x2019; at the inaugural Summit in 2013. <br>\n <br>\n Engineer Saad Al Muhannadi, President of Qatar Foundation, said: &#x201C;Qatar Foundation is proud to have established WISH, which aims to ensure impactful outcomes in healthcare innovation in Qatar, the region and beyond. The second summit in 2015 will be crucial for the progression of collaborative action focused on innovative methods to solve today&#x2019;s global healthcare issues.
