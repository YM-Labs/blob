Why does the construction industry traditionally spend insignificant amounts on research and development compared with other sectors, and what drives the research which does take place?&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/26-03-2014_QGBC%20Calls%20for%20Innovative%20Research%20Strategies_ENGLISH.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf73","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-green-building-council-calls-for-more-innovative-research-strategies-in-construction-sector","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-green-building-council-calls-for-more-innovative-research-strategies-in-construction-sector","title":"Qatar Green Building Council Calls for More Innovative Research Strategies in Construction Sector"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
