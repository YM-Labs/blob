A welcoming committee received the First Lady and her delegation at the Qatar Foundation Visitors Center. <br>\n <br>\n The First Lady and her delegation were first shown a presentation which outlined the vision and mission of Qatar Foundation. They were also introduced to Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s many educational initiatives, community development plans and scientific research programmes. <br>\n <br>\n They were also briefed on Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s various sustainability initiatives and climate action solutions. After the presentation, they were shown an impressive 3D scale model of the current buildings and construction projects underway at Qatar Foundation.<br>\n <br>\n H.E. Mrs Sall is steadfast in her commitment to improving the living and working conditions of the Senegalese people. In her current role as Chairperson of &#x2018;Fondation Servir Le Senegal,&#x2019; her vision is to implement initiatives to advance the nation&#x2019;s development across a number of sectors, many of which chime closely with those of Qatar Foundation. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;It was a pleasure to visit Qatar Foundation and to see all the facilities they provide. I have been truly impressed to see the unique projects and initiatives currently underway in the fields of education, science and community development. This is a remarkable organisation,&#x201D; explained H.E. Mrs Sall.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The visit is an inspiration for &#x2018;Fondation Servir Le Senegal&#x2019; and we hope to build something as spectacular as Qatar Foundation, which is serving not only Qatar but the region. We hope to collaborate on future projects by tapping into the academic and scientific expertise that Qatar Foundation offers.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n As the visit drew to a close, the First Lady signed the visitor&#x2019;s book. The delegation&#x2019;s trip to Doha aims to enhance relations between Qatar and Senegal while promoting close collaboration in the fields of education, science, and research.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf22","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-an-inspiration-to-first-lady-of-senegal","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-an-inspiration-to-first-lady-of-senegal","title":"Qatar Foundation An ‘Inspiration’ To First Lady Of Senegal"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
