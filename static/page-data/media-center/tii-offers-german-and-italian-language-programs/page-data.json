Dr. Milena Savova, Director of the Language Center, explained: &#x201C;In an increasingly interconnected world, the ability to communicate effectively has become crucial in our diverse society and much sought-after in the job market. Learning another language or even a third, fourth and fifth, can open so many doors no matter what your field is. The addition of Italian and German enrich our offering which will hopefully continue to expand over the coming years.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To find out more about the programs offered by the Language Center at HBKU&#x2019;s TII, visit www.tii.qa.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170103%20Language%20Center%20Program%20-%20EN.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24qf2","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/tii-offers-german-and-italian-language-programs","currSlug":"/media-center/tii-offers-german-and-italian-language-programs","title":"TII Offers German and Italian Language Programs"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
