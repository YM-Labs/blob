The male and female high school students visited the co-educational, English language university foundation program on separate days to participate in the event. &#x201C;Answers Quest&#x201D; is similar to a treasure hunt. <br>\n <img width=\"639\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Answers%20Quest_Boys_PRESS-17.jpg\" alt=\"Answers Quest\"><br>\n Competing teams of high school students were led around the ABP&#x2019;s campus in Education City by ABP faculty, staff members, and current ABP students to find answers to questions about the ABP.The winning team was the first group to make it back to the starting point with all the correct answers.<br>\n <br>\n Answers Quest is organized a number of times a year and aims to introduce high school students to the ABP, but from a different perspective. The event personalizes the program, allowing for prospective students to interact with faculty, staff and students. Students are seen rushing around the ABP, trying to find the answers they seek and competing to win. They get the same information they would normally receive from an ABP presentation, but in a fun and memorable manner. <br>\n <img width=\"639\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Answers%20Quest_Boys_PRESS3-17.jpg\" alt=\"Answers Quest_Boys_PRESS3.jpg\"><br>\n Six girls&#x2019; schools and eight boys&#x2019; schools participated in the Answers Quest event this spring.
