During the eight-day initiative, ROTA female helpers mainly cleaned, scraped and repaired the walls. Following the restoration work, the volunteers assembled and installed new furniture on completion of the renovation work.<br>\n <br>\n In the first pilot year of the project, &apos;Reach Into Qatar&apos;, will focus on providing quarterly house renovations for families in need in communities across Qatar. ROTA is also working alongside Qatar Foundation&apos;s Facilities Management Directorate, which provides maintenance support for each renovation.<br>\n <br>\n While the majority of ROTA&#x2019;s international work focuses on countries around Asia and the Middle East, this project was developed by ROTA&#x2019;s National Program Department to specifically extend assistance to communities within Qatar but outside of Doha.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/PRL_ROTA%20and%20Msheireb%20Volunteers%20Successfully%20Conclude%20Complete%20House%20Makeover%20in%20Sailiyah%20(ENGLISH)%20(3).pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20qf38","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/rota-and-msheireb-volunteers-successfully-conclude-complete-house-makeover-in-sailiyah","currSlug":"/media-center/rota-and-msheireb-volunteers-successfully-conclude-complete-house-makeover-in-sailiyah","title":"ROTA and Msheireb Volunteers Successfully Conclude Complete House Makeover in Sailiyah"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
