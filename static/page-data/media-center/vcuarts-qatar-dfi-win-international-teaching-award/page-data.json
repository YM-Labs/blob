There are 190 CIDA-accredited programs in the US, UAE, Canada, and Qatar, including VCUarts Qatar&#x2019;s Interior Design program. <br>\n <br>\n The teaching collaboration was led by Interior Design program Associate Professor Johan Granberg from VCUarts Qatar; Ben Robinson, Producer / Internship Programme Manager, and Fahad Al Kuwari, Youth Programmes Coordinator, from DFI, all of whom were given the Merit Award for their work on the project. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Incrementally distancing ourselves from silo-ed education, this course finds impetus in the hybridization of learning and application of design theories, as well-evidenced in the Council for Interior Design Accreditation standards, which underscore the necessity for students work &#x201C;to demonstrate the ability to effectively collaborate with multiple disciplines in developing design solutions&#x201D;&#x201D; said Cherif Amor, the Chair of VCUarts Qatar&#x2019;s Interior Design program. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Exploring Space through the Lens&#x2014;Production Design&#x201D; was structured in three phases: workshops, production, and postproduction. <br>\n <br>\n In the workshops, the students worked to build up an understanding of the inner workings of film making, such as by creating models, storyboards, mood&#x2010;boards, title sequences, and so on.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We took the written word and translated it into shapes and forms that allowed us to make an environment plausible,&#x201D; said senior interior design program students Hemian Al-Noaimi and Sara Mashadi. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The scale and quality of the production is something that the average person would never imagine was the work of interior design students,&#x201D; said senior interior design program students Nada Ibrahim and Al Jazi Al-Thani. <br>\n <br>\n <br>\n For more information about VCUarts Qatar&#x2019;s Interior Design program, please visit <a href=\"http://www.qatar.vcu.edu/interiordesign\">http://www.qatar.vcu.edu/interiordesign </a><br>\n <br>\n To read more, click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/VCUQ_DFI_CIDA_ENG_20(3).pdf\">here</a>.&#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24qf63","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/vcuarts-qatar-dfi-win-international-teaching-award","currSlug":"/media-center/vcuarts-qatar-dfi-win-international-teaching-award","title":"VCUarts Qatar, DFI Win International Teaching Award"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
