The survey results found that of the women who participated in the study, 90.7% were aware of breast cancer. Of those women, 7.6% were assessed with having basic knowledge of breast cancer screening(BCS); 28.9% were aware of breast self-examination (BSE); 41.8% were aware of clinical breast exams (CBE), and 26.9% were aware of mammograms.<br>\n <br>\n The lack of wide-spread knowledge translated to the low rates of breast cancer screenings and self-examinations by the women in the study. Only 13.8% performed BSE monthly, 31.3% had a CBE once a year or once every two years, and 26.9% of women 40 years of age or older had a mammogram once a year or once every two years.<br>\n <br>\n Coinciding with this study was the launch of the National Cancer Strategy in May 2011. The five-year campaign from 2011-2016 had the ultimate goal of significantly reducing the burden of cancer in the State of Qatar and to strive to provide cancer care at a standard of excellence, that stands out to the Gulf region and further afield.<br>\n <br>\n In addition to this, screening programs were launched at primary health care centres across Qatar in 2016 which dramatically saw the increase in patients proactively registering for screening. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/02%2004%202017%20Cancer%20Awareness%20%20Editorial_ENG.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf96","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-press-highlights-advances-in-breast-cancer-awareness","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-press-highlights-advances-in-breast-cancer-awareness","title":"HBKU Press Highlights Advances in Breast Cancer Awareness"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
