Endocrine disruptors can adversely affect fertility and also pose a significant risk to unborn children and babies because their neural systems and organs are still growing and are highly sensitive to hormonal changes.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Tania Jaber, who graduated from WCM-Q in 2011, then undertook a residency in internal medicine at Cleveland Clinic in the US, before taking a fellowship in endocrinology at the University of Texas and then an advanced fellowship in endocrine cancers at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo3-17.jpg\" alt=\"Photo3.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n Each activity was accredited locally by the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners-Accreditation Department (QCHP-AD) and internationally by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME).<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/171104%20English%20Three%20experts%20speak%20at%20WCM-Q%20Grand%20Rounds.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf90","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/three-experts-speak-at-wcm-q-grand-rounds","currSlug":"/media-center/three-experts-speak-at-wcm-q-grand-rounds","title":"Three Experts Speak at WCM-Q Grand Rounds"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
