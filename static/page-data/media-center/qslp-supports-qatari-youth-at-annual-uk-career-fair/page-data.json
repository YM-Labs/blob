Bringing them together with various public and private organizations for potential employment and sponsorship upon graduation, the fair continued to prove successful in placing Qatari graduates in their national job market.<br>\n <br>\n This year&#x2019;s fair was attended by His Excellency Khalid Rashid Al Mansouri, Ambassador of the State of Qatar to the UK, Dr Wyatt Hume, Executive Director of Education, Training and Development, QF R&amp;D, and Abdulla Yousuf Al Mulla, Executive Director of Operations, QF R&amp;D. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Wyatt Hume said, &#x201C;Our inaugural attendance at the UK career fair saw us recruit three students onto the QSLP Research Undergraduate Track last year, which is why we returned once again this year to garner further support for Qatar&#x2019;s rapidly evolving research sector.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n QSLP mainly focuses on fields of scientific research of strategic importance to the needs of the State of Qatar and the wider Middle East and North African region, including technology, biomedicine, information technology, and social and human sciences.<br>\n <br>\n Meanwhile, the UK career fair also provides Qatari organizations with an excellent opportunity to attract Qatari youth currently enrolled in various universities across the UK. In turn, it also allows graduates, and all other interested parties seeking employment in Qatar, a chance to directly communicate with the relevant recruitment centers.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/04-03-2014%20QF%20QSLP%20UK%20Career%20Fair_En_Final.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf67","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qslp-supports-qatari-youth-at-annual-uk-career-fair","currSlug":"/media-center/qslp-supports-qatari-youth-at-annual-uk-career-fair","title":"QSLP Supports Qatari Youth at Annual UK Career Fair"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
