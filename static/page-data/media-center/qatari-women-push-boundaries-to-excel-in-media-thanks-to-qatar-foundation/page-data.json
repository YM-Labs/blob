The evolution towards a more participatory environment can be seen in the rising number of outstanding female graduates at Northwestern University in Qatar (NU-Q), an educational establishment specializing in media within the campus of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development.<br>\n <br>\n Sara Abdulaziz Al Derham, 21, is a positive example of this change. She has earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Communication from NU-Q, with a major in Media Industries and Technology. Her passion for the field of communication knows no bounds, as is evident from her exemplary university performance and pursuit of extracurricular activities.<br>\n <br>\n Despite being faced with some resistance from family members regarding her choice of major, Sara felt it was necessary to persevere and follow her dreams. Initially, she was interested in a career in medicine and volunteered at a local hospital during her time in high school, but she soon had a change of heart. She attributes this to her desire for a dynamic and versatile career that builds upon her interest in photography, art and debate.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;It was like this moment when I had an epiphany. I had to stop and ask myself which major would allow me to do all the things I love and would not limit me,&#x201D; explains Sara. &#x201C;I wanted a field that constantly changes and where I could learn in the process and experiment. This was the ideal choice for me, because right now I can report, photograph, make short films, and research.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n To further complement her interest in media and culture, Sara has completed a Certificate in Middle East Studies from NU-Q. In the future, the high-achiever hopes to join Qatar&#x2019;s diplomatic corps. <br>\n <br>\n Sara&#x2019;s tenacity to lead and help others choose the right career prompted her to establish a non-profit voluntary organisation in 2011 called &#x2018;Ta2heel&#x2019;. The program&#x2019;s goal is to prepare high school students for university by developing their leadership and communication skills, while giving them a broad overview of educational opportunities. This year, Ta2heel was awarded Student Organisation of the Year at the Hamad bin Khalifa University Takreem Award Ceremony. <br>\n <br>\n And the future looks promising. Sara has applied to graduate school in the UK and hopes to pursue a degree in Creative Media and Cultural Studies before joining Qatar Airways. As she wraps up one chapter of her life and begins another, she advises students, &#x201C;Plan your life the way you want because at the end of the day, it&#x2019;s your choices that are going to take you places.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Haya Al-Mannai, 21, is another exceptional Northwestern University in Qatar graduate with a passion for journalism and a commitment to lifelong learning. In addition to earning her Bachelor of Science degree in Journalism, she also holds a Certificate in Public Relations and a Certificate in Middle East Studies. Haya plans to pursue a postgraduate education in Middle East studies in the near future.<br>\n <br>\n Although her choice of career was a little unusual, Haya explains that her family was extremely supportive of her decision and is very proud to see her reach the end of the line.<br>\n <br>\n During the course of her study, Haya has participated in a number of extracurricular activities and played a role in student government. She also successfully completed a journalism residency at Bloomsbury Publishing in the UK. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/06-05-2014_Qatari%20Women%20Push%20Boundaries%20to%20Excel%20in%20Media_En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf15","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatari-women-push-boundaries-to-excel-in-media-thanks-to-qatar-foundation","currSlug":"/media-center/qatari-women-push-boundaries-to-excel-in-media-thanks-to-qatar-foundation","title":"Qatari Women Push Boundaries to Excel in Media Thanks To Qatar Foundation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
