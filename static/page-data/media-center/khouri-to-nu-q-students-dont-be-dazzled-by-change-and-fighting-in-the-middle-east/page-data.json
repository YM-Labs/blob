He currently serves as a member of NU-Q&#x2019;s Joint Advisory Board and has been a fellow and visiting scholar at Harvard University, Princeton University and Stanford University. <br>\n <br>\n His keynote talk &#x201C;Craft, Art, Entertainment or Activism: the role of the Journalist in the Middle East Today,&#x201D; captivated the NU-Q community. In it, he urged young journalists not only to focus on what he called the &#x201C;most intense and profound moment of change since the Middle East became the modern Middle East,&#x201D; but also to pursue context and a deeper understanding of the more constant and enduring values in the region. This, he maintained, is central to the success of good journalists and to meaningful citizenship.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I think it is important to note the immense changes but also the continuity in some areas, and not to be dazzled by the cacophony of change - the fighting and the war, explosions and armies, drums and all that,&#x201D; Khouri said. &#x201C;To recognize that at the core of society, the most fundamental relationships of power, identity and the roles of people have not changed very much, impacts journalism in a big way.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Acute awareness of often competing forces such as professionalism, commercialization, privatization, politicization, sectarianization and fragmentation, he said, give way to a fundamentally strong media landscape and are particularly important in the region.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/NU-Q%20Rami%20Khouri_EN_FInal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong> </a> &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf70","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/khouri-to-nu-q-students-dont-be-dazzled-by-change-and-fighting-in-the-middle-east","currSlug":"/media-center/khouri-to-nu-q-students-dont-be-dazzled-by-change-and-fighting-in-the-middle-east","title":"Khouri to NU-Q Students: Don’t be Dazzled by Change and Fighting in the Middle East"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
