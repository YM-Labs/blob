This model insures that interdisciplinary work &#x2013; which has traditionally fallen between the aims and scopes of two journals &#x2013; finds a home in the world of academic journals. Furthermore, it gives more authors the opportunity to publish as long as they have performed the science, methodology and research in a coherent, original and ethical manner. <br>\n <br>\n Following the 6th Annual Translation Conference hosted by the Translation and Interpreting Institute (TII), which is part of of Hamad Bin Khalifa University&#x2019;s College of Humanities and Social Sciences, QScience Connect published a special issue titled &#x201C;Translating the Gulf: Beyond Fault Lines&#x201D;. <br>\n <br>\n Holding the same title, the Translation Conference brought together a diverse array of scholars to explore &#x2013; in workshops and presentations &#x2013; how translation is integral to the creation of knowledge and the bridging of gaps within and across cultures, in and beyond the Gulf. <br>\n <br>\n Language is both a vital tool to understanding societal challenges and a possible mechanism for developing solutions. The conference and these articles demonstrate that translation &#x2013; the process of rendering one language into another &#x2013; has both different understandings and a variety of applications. Through QScience Connect, we are able to engage with the lively and healthy debate surrounding the role of translation in bridging cultural and societal gaps in the Arab world, and beyond.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QScience%20Connect%20Translation_ENG%20final%20.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf9","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-press-opens-up-a-world-of-new-research","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-press-opens-up-a-world-of-new-research","title":"HBKU Press Opens Up A World of New Research"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
