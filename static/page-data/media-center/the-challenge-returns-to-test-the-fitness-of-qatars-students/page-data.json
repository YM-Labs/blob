It was also a chance for them to deliver their students&#x2019; research posters for the Poster Competition. <br>\n <br>\n Held in conjunction with The Challenge, the Poster Competition is a chance for students to exercise their brains rather than their muscles and design a health-related poster. In all, 22 schools will participate in The Challenge and Poster Competition.<br>\n <br>\n The posters that the children submitted were collected and have been judged by a panel of experts from WCMC-Q and the Supreme Council of Health. The winners will be announced during The Challenge where all the posters will be on display.<br>\n <img width=\"382\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Group%20Photo-%20the%20challenge-9.jpg\" alt=\"Group Photo- the challenge.jpg\"><br>\n During the WCMC-Q briefing, the students and teachers were shown a film of last year&#x2019;s Challenge and promised that there would be some new games. They were also urged to bring as many family and friends along as possible to ensure there is plenty of support for their school. <br>\n <br>\n Boys and girls will compete separately to finish each game with the top three boys&#x2019; teams and top three girls&#x2019; teams being awarded gold, silver and bronze. The top school will also receive a trophy. The students involved are all from the middle school and each one will receive a certificate of appreciation.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/140217%20English%20The%20Challenge%20returns%20to%20test%20the%20fitness%20of%20Qatars%20students.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf59","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/the-challenge-returns-to-test-the-fitness-of-qatars-students","currSlug":"/media-center/the-challenge-returns-to-test-the-fitness-of-qatars-students","title":"The Challenge Returns To Test The Fitness Of Qatar’s Students"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
