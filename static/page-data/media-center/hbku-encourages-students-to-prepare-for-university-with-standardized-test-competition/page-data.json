There is also a competition for the Explore test, which is aimed at preparing students in Grades 8 and 9 for the ACT test. <br>\n <br>\n Faisal Al Janahi, Testing Coordinator at HBKU said: &#x201C;Early tests are the best way for students to start preparing for the ACT and SAT admission tests. In addition to becoming more comfortable with the idea of taking a standardized test, students will receive very detailed feedback from the test company on their strengths and also on areas where they need to improve.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n HBKU has also developed a competition for those students who rise to the challenge set forth. They have identified several categories in which students will compete via their test results. Those who score the highest will be recognized with a certificate of achievement, prizes, and their names in the local papers. <br>\n <br>\n HBKU also offers high school students sessions, workshops and programs to provide awareness about majors offered at the various partner universities and also to support students in preparing for admission.<br>\n <br>\n The first practice exam will be on Saturday, 15 February, with tests being held approximately every two weeks at the HBKU Student Center.
