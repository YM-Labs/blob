Delegates comprising environmentalists, experts, academics and industry practitioners noted that the success of Qatar&#x2019;s long-term sustainability strategy relies heavily on citizens having a sound understanding of the concept and the ability to adopt it within their lifestyles. <br>\n <br>\n During his opening address on the second day of the conference, Engineer Meshal Al Shamari, QGBC Director, said: &#x201C;The Qatar Green Building Conference and Qatar Sustainability Week are emphasising the importance of community engagement and education as being an integral part of the solution to the country&#x2019;s sustainability challenges. Sustainable education cannot be stressed enough. A shift in people&#x2019;s understanding and behaviour is required. If members of society are familiar with the challenges, they will then be able to constructively contribute to forming solutions in a bid to address the increasing effects of climate change.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_QGBC_Behaviour%20Change_PR_EN-2016%2011%2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2qf25","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/behaviour-shift-key-to-sustainability-in-qatar","currSlug":"/media-center/behaviour-shift-key-to-sustainability-in-qatar","title":"Behaviour Shift Key to Sustainability in Qatar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
