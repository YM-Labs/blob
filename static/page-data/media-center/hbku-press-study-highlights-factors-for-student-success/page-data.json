Some interviewees noted that, even where the students considered themselves capable and proficient in English, the demanding level of English proficiency in post-secondary institutions sometimes held them back from reaching their full potential. <br>\n <br>\n The research suggests that increased contact between students and faculty promotes higher level of student satisfaction with the college experience because the faculty is in a position of authority and are able to provide support, direction and guidance to students. Students need to interact with faculty to support and increase their own personal achievements, persistence, and academic skills. The greater the potential among students to connect with university life, the greater they will engage in it, promote it, and have some affinity to it; at which point, even language barriers or differences in learning methods can be overcome and success can be achieved. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/01%2017%202017%20Success%20in%20Universities%20article_ENG.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf20","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-press-study-highlights-factors-for-student-success","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-press-study-highlights-factors-for-student-success","title":"HBKU Press Study Highlights Factors for Student Success"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
