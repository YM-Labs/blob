He is currently produces content for TRT World, a Turkish public broadcaster’s digital English content service. <br>\n<img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/IMG_6663-24.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6663.jpeg\" width=\"560\" height=\"300\"><br>\nMustafa, who has taught classes at NU-Q in the past, is attending several multimedia and digital reporting classes to advise students on current trends and to share his thoughts on journalism and accurate reporting. Using his expertise in the field, he is advising journalism students on the importance of learning how to create multiple versions of the same story for different media platforms.<br>\n<br>\n“Mr. Mustafa is an example of a journalist with the skills to identify humanitarian stories – and then being able to share those stories with an international audience. Using the multimedia experiences he has developed, and sharing them with our students, helps bring to life the theories and practices Northwestern students learn in the classroom. It also exposes them to the opportunities that they will be able to pursue as professionals,” said Everette E. Dennis, dean and CEO at NU-Q. <br>\n<br>\nIn a lively session with third-year journalism students, Mustafa engaged in a dialogue about the role of social media, and how such immediate content generating outlets are changing the ways in which news is gathered and shared. <br>\n<br>\nOther discussions with students centered around video production and alternatives to using heavy duty equipment when needed. Mustafa screened some of his work in Greece and Iraq, as he interviewed various refugees on their living conditions and personal aspirations, often using his iPhone to film and report. <br>\n<br>\nFor the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Ali%20Mustafa%20final%20EV.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf53","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/international-journalist-shares-experiences-with-nu-q-students","currSlug":"/media-center/international-journalist-shares-experiences-with-nu-q-students","title":"International Journalist Shares Experiences With NU-Q Students"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
