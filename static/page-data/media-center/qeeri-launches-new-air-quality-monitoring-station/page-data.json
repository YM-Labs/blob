They forge cooperative bonds between QEERI&#x2019;s researchers and national stakeholders by collecting reliable data that helps to quantify the impact of poor air quality on environment, energy, and health systems in Qatar. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QEERI%202-17.jpg\" alt=\"QEERI 2.jpg\" height=\"424\" width=\"640\"><br>\n Dr. Marc Vermeersch, Executive Director, QEERI, said: &#x201C;We are committed toward providing a better understanding of Qatar&#x2019;s air quality, including its primary causes and impact. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;This information can help to provide valuable information to the local community and guide best-practice development in the health and safety sectors. Consequently, we have established a close working relationship with a number of private and governmental stakeholders from across various industries to join forces on this nationally significant initiative.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n QEERI&#x2019;s air quality and climate change research activities are designed to support the systematic development and evaluation of national policies, strategies, and technologies aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of poor air quality as well as adapting to climate change. <br>\n <br>\n Mohammed Ayoub, Air Quality and Climate Change Research Portfolio Lead, QEERI said: &#x201C;The monitoring network gives us a clearer understanding of the underlying causes of Qatar&#x2019;s air quality, including the sources and types of pollutants, the mechanisms that induce episodic days, and the contribution of long-range transport of polluted air masses into Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;As such, it forms the basis for the development of sustainable methodologies for future adaptations to climate change. The first AQMS was commissioned in 2014 and, by the end of the year, we plan to establish a total of six stations across the greater Doha area.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Currently, four AQM stations are operational in Qatar Foundation, Ash-Shahaniyah, Al-Soudan, and Al-Wakrah, with further stations at Hamad Medical City and Al-Thumama being under commissioning. The location of each station was carefully selected based on siting studies that account for population distribution, prevalent wind direction, land use, and future infrastructure development plans. T<br>\n <br>\n The Qatar Foundation AQMS &#x2018;super site&#x2019; was established on the roof of the HBKU Research Complex, and will house the upcoming Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor, together with other high-fidelity measurements.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180925%20-%20QEERI%20AQMS%20-%20EN.pdf\">here</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17qf3","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qeeri-launches-new-air-quality-monitoring-station","currSlug":"/media-center/qeeri-launches-new-air-quality-monitoring-station","title":"QEERI Launches New Air Quality Monitoring Station"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
