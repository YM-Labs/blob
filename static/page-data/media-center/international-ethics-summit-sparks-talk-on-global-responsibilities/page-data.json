A strong ethical commitment, compliance with corporate governance, competence, and effective business practices are strongly intertwined. An ethical organisational culture coupled with fit-for-purpose controls and appropriate levels of corporate governance brings significant benefits to organisation&#x2019;s successful business decisions while safeguarding leaders and employees at large.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Ethical practices are essential to the engineering profession and are the foundation of Texas A&amp;M&#x2019;s core values. Texas A&amp;M at Qatar strives to develop ethical engineers and well-rounded leaders of character who serve the greater good. These Aggie engineers enrich Qatar&#x2019;s industry and are already playing a key role in the country&#x2019;s development and progress in achieving the goals put forward in Qatar&#x2019;s National Vision 2030. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. C&#xE9;sar O. Malav&#xE9;, dean of Texas A&amp;M at Qatar, said: &#x201C;At Texas A&amp;M at Qatar, we produce mindful, moral engineers and train our students to consider more than just the technical side of the challenges they will address in their careers. As Qatar continues its transition toward a technology- and knowledge-based economy, these ethical issues will take a larger role. We are proud to be part of this focus on the human side of engineering and to partner with industry leaders in Qatar so that we can grow into a national and international leader in ethics research and education.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Topics discussed include ethical responsibility and risk in an age of globalization, ethics in research and development, modern humanitarianism, and how institutional structures can shape ethical cultures. Several presentations considered challenges unique to the Gulf and address the emergence of western education in the region and its effects on society and institutions. <br>\n <br>\n Keynote addresses feature discussions of moral responsibilities in a global era, 21 century ethical challenges to the humanities, and the role humility in politics and literature considering western and eastern traditions recommending humility in leadership.
