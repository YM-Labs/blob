QSTP will host the first IASP World Conference in the Arab region in 2014 in Doha. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Science and technology parks have been around since the early 1950&#x2019;s but all eyes are now turning to technology start-ups in the hyper-connected Middle East,&#x201D; said Head of the IASP 2014 Organizing Committee and QSTP Managing Director Hamad Al-Kuwari. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;In the GCC in particular, these hubs for innovation play a critical role in sparking meaningful collaboration between industry, government and academia. Our challenge is not just to keep pace with the world&#x2019;s most tech-savvy generation of innovators, but to support them further.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n A United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization&#x2019;s (UNESCO) Science Report 2010 found that linkages between academia and industry in Arab States were sometimes lacking and need to be strengthened. <br>\n <br>\n The report cited Qatar as an example of an Arab state tackling the issue by setting up a science park and implementing a national research strategy. Historically, the region has enjoyed bright clusters of innovation in places like Jordan. <br>\n <br>\n A 2012 survey by the renowned polling firm Gallup found that one in three Qatari nationals between the ages of 15 and 29 planned to start a business in the next 12 months, the highest proportion in the Arab world at that time.<br>\n <br>\n For speaker registration and abstract submission, please visit: <a href=\"http://www.iasp2014doha.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.iasp2014doha.com</a><br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/12%20Dec_Oman%20Qatar%20IASP%20Workshop_ENG%20FinalKMA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf90","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/oman-meet-sparks-conversation-about-role-of-science-and-tech-parks-in-the-gcc","currSlug":"/media-center/oman-meet-sparks-conversation-about-role-of-science-and-tech-parks-in-the-gcc","title":"Oman Meet Sparks Conversation About Role Of Science And Tech Parks In The GCC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
