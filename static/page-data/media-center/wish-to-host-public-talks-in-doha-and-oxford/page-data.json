The topics announced so far include viral hepatitis, eye health, nursing and universal health coverage, and design in health.<br>\n <br>\n The World Health Organization defines palliative care as an approach that leads to the improvement of the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem of terminal or life-threatening illness. This is achieved through the prevention of suffering by means of early identification and pain management. Palliative care also tackles other problems of well-being such as physical pain, psychosocial unrest, and spiritual treatment.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/WISH_EN.pdf\">here</a>.<br>\n <br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28qf45","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-to-host-public-talks-in-doha-and-oxford","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-to-host-public-talks-in-doha-and-oxford","title":"WISH to Host Public Talks in Doha and Oxford"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
