Occidental Petroleum of Qatar Ltd. (Oxy Qatar) is the exclusive industry sponsor of TAMUQ&#x2019;s STEM programs, including FE and SEA. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/DSC_0652-17.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_0652.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n &quot;Through these engineering programs, students are able to develop and discover their interests in science and technology, as well as begin to set a chosen pathway into college,&quot; said Andrew H. Kershaw, President &amp; General Manager of Oxy Qatar. &#x201C;Occidental strives to be a partner of choice everywhere we operate, by investing time and resources in programs that strengthen local communities. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/DSC_0868-17.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_0868.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n &#x201C;We support STEM at TAMUQ because the programs make science fun and teach school children about the importance of technology and innovation, and, in turn, help to nurture their hidden talents as our future engineering leaders.&#x201D;<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/DSC_0910-17.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_0910.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n SEA is an elite, 10-day STEM outreach program for 24 exceptional high school students from Grade 11-12 who have been named &#x2018;Qatar National Vision Scholars&#x2019;, introducing them to advanced topics in engineering and science while teaching important problem-solving skills. The students are working with TAMUQ faculty members on real-life, hands-on research projects related to Qatar&#x2019;s Research Grand Challenges. <br>\n <br>\n Mahmoud Esameldin Osman, a Qatar National Vision Scholar, said SEA is important to students pursuing engineering because it introduces them to different types of workshops and engineering majors. &#x201C;Participating in this program helps me a lot to find out where I am and what I&#x2019;m interested in,&#x201D; he said. <br>\n <br>\n Future Engineers: High Flyers, which runs parallel to SEA, consists of 30 students from Grades 9, 10, and 11, who are learning about aeronautical engineering by discussing principles of flight, building their own radio-controlled craft, and using computer-aided-design software to design and 3D-print indoor gliders. <br>\n <br>\n Dana Almaadeed, an FE student, said: &#x201C;This program is very important because it gives a glimpse of what it feels like to be an engineer and a student of engineering, but also how it feels to work like an adult.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/TAMUQ-Press%20Release-%20Week%201.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf18","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/tamuq-summer-programs-expand-students-stem-skills","currSlug":"/media-center/tamuq-summer-programs-expand-students-stem-skills","title":"TAMUQ Summer Programs Expand Students' STEM Skills"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
