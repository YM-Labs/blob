Instead, a single admission process will determine entrance to a six-year medical education program and students will progress through the course according to advancement criteria, which includes academic performance, professionalism and commitment to the profession of medicine.<br>\n <br>\n Students who successfully complete the six-year program are awarded the Cornell University Doctor of Medicine degree &#x2013; the same qualification awarded to Cornell students who complete their studies in the United States.<br>\n <br>\n <img width=\"382\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/First_Resdonders_14-1032-9.jpg\" alt=\"First_Resdonders_14-1032.JPG\">One of the aims of the integrated program is to build upon and enhance WCMC-Q&#x2019;s already strong reputation for producing medical graduates who are able to gain acceptance to post-graduation residency training programs at elite hospitals all over the world. WCMC-Q graduates have been placed on residency programs at top-level institutions that include Johns Hopkins Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Cleveland Clinic and Hamad Medical Corporation, among many others. <br>\n <br>\n Students at WCMC-Q benefit from a wide network of academic and personal support mechanisms, which allow the college to offerpersonalized education that meets the needs and interests of each individual. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://app/media/24123\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf94","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcmc-q-unveils-6-year-integrated-medical-education-program","currSlug":"/media-center/wcmc-q-unveils-6-year-integrated-medical-education-program","title":"WCMC-Q Unveils 6-year Integrated Medical Education Program"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
