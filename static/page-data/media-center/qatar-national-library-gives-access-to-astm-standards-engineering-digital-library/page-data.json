Anyone who lives in Qatar and has a valid Qatari ID/Residence Permit is eligible for a free library registration and can then access the ASTM standards.<br>\n <br>\n Available online and updated weekly, the ASTM Standards &amp; Engineering Digital Library (SEDL), contains all 13,000+ ASTM standards, 114,000 pages of peer-reviewed journal papers, over 1,500 ebooks (STP&#x2019;s) and other technical information such as manuals and videos. So far, more than 160 companies in Qatar have registered; gaining access to the technical information. <br>\n <br>\n ASTM standards are used extensively in Qatar; within the carbon industry, widely cited in the Qatar Construction Specification (QCS), and commonly referred to in academic institutions. ASTM is also helping to develop national standards in Qatar following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Laboratories and Standardization Affairs (QS), part of the Qatar Ministry of Environment. <br>\n <br>\n The ASTM MOU program supports open dialogue with national standards bodies worldwide, facilitates standards development, and where possible, it helps to avoid duplication of work. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QNL%20and%20ASTM%20PR%20-%20English%20-%20Final.pdf\">click here</a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15qf10","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-national-library-gives-access-to-astm-standards-engineering-digital-library","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-national-library-gives-access-to-astm-standards-engineering-digital-library","title":"Qatar National Library Gives Access To ASTM Standards & Engineering Digital Library"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
