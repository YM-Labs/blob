By combining endothelial cells with cardiomyocytes &#x2013; the heart&#x2019;s muscle cells &#x2013; the researchers were able to create muscle cells in a petri dish that beat together in a regular rhythm, similar to endogenous cardiomyocytes.<br>\n <br>\n However, the research team believes that the endothelial cells are creating a &#x2018;bridge&#x2019; between the cardiac cells, ensuring they act as one and as they would in the human heart. If true, the technique could one day be used to help heal cardiac infractions or support people with a heartbeat too weak due to degenerative heart disease such as in ischemic disease or diabetes.<br>\n <br>\n At the moment, that is the million-dollar question, so the next step is to create a model of heart ischemia in mice and see if the properties and functionality that the team hopes will be seen are seen. <br>\n <br>\n The research was only possible thanks to support from Qatar National Research Fund with grants NPRP8-1898-3-392 and NPRP 6-1131-3-268.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Khaled Machaca, Associate Dean of Research at WCM-Q, said Dr. Tabrizi&#x2019;s research provides an excellent example of how QNRF support of basic research translates into tangible results that are likely to improve the health of the Qatari population in the long term. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170821%20English%20Scientists%20create%20blood%20in%20the%20laboratory.pdf\">here</a></strong>.</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf32","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-scientists-closer-to-creating-blood-in-lab","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-scientists-closer-to-creating-blood-in-lab","title":"WCM-Q Scientists Closer to Creating Blood in Lab"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
