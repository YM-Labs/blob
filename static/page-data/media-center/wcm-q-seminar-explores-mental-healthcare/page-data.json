By working together we can identify the service gaps and educate the various stakeholders in global best practices to ensure prompt, respectful and effective care for those in need. There are lessons to be learned from each other and candid dialogue about mental illness and challenges can go a long way in reducing stigma for patients and their families.&#x201D;<br>\n <img width=\"6048\" height=\"4032\" alt=\"null\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo1.jpg\"><br>\n Dr. Suhaila Ghuloum, Senior Consultant at the Psychiatry Department at HMC, played a key role in the organization of the seminar and was also one of the speakers at the event.
