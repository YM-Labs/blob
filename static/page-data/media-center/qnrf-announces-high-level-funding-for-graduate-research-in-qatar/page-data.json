In addition, a generous living allowance will include travel, accommodation and insurance for international students and their dependents. Successful Qatari students will also receive a retention allowance of an additional eight percent of the stipend. <br>\n <br>\n Prospective students must show an interest in GSRA support when applying for enrolment in any approved graduate studies at a QNRF-approved institution. QNRF has a number of other funding programs available for research in Qatar, with GSRA being the latest. <br>\n <br>\n There will be two award cycles of GSRA per academic year, one beginning in the fall semester and one in the spring semester.<br>\n <br>\n For the first cycle, the application process will start on 23 September 2013. The Request for Proposal and timeline updates have been made available on QNRF&#x2019;s website. A public presentation, as well as webinars for the benefit of international applicants, will be held in October. <br>\n <br>\n The dates for these will be updated on QNRF website, social media channels and will be communicated to all applicants registered in QNRF&#x2019;s database.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/09.18.13%20QNRF%20GSRA%201st%20cycle%20launch_ENG%20PR_v1.pdf\">here</a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf20","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qnrf-announces-high-level-funding-for-graduate-research-in-qatar","currSlug":"/media-center/qnrf-announces-high-level-funding-for-graduate-research-in-qatar","title":"QNRF Announces High-Level Funding For Graduate Research In Qatar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
