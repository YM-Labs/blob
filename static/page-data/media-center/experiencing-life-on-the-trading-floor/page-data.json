The students initially congregated on the trading floor, where they learned to negotiate face-to-face with other students. <br>\n <br>\n They later moved onto electronic markets connected by online networks where negotiations were completed electronically. Finally, they were introduced to &#x2018;Sukuk,&#x2019; which means &#x2018;financial instrument&#x2019; in Arabic. The &#x2018;Sukuk&#x2019; market is one of the fastest growing market segments in the world today and is currently worth more than QR862 billion. <br>\n <br>\n According to Thomas Emerson, distinguished career professor of entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, markets are important to the financial future and growth of Qatar, especially as Qatar&#x2019;s stock exchange status looks to be upgraded this year from &#x2018;Frontier&#x2019; to &#x2018;Emerging Market&#x2019; by US-based provider of global stock market indices, Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI).<br>\n <img width=\"382\" height=\"255\" alt=\"02.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/02-9.jpg\"><br>\n &#x201C;With the MCSI upgrade, we expect global fund managers to funnel up to QR3.65 billion into the Qatari market,&#x201D; said Emerson. <br>\n <br>\n The expectation is for this trajectory to continue in coming years. It is therefore essential that Qatar&#x2019;s local talent of future financial professionals and market traders are well-versed in all aspects of Financial Trading Systems,&#x201D; he added.<br>\n <br>\n Carnegie Mellon&#x2019;s Business Administration program has earned recognition for its approach to the study of business management as a science. Graduates of the program are well prepared to make a significant impact in business and in society.<br>\n <br>\n Carnegie Mellon Qatar faculty are keen to build on the success of the first Tajer-Investment for Qatar and hope to expand the program in the future.<br>\n <br>\n The application deadline for Fall 2014 admission to Carnegie Mellon is 1 March 2014. <br>\n <br>\n For more information about the application process, visit: <a href=\"http://www.qatar.cmu.edu/admission\" target=\"_blank\">www.qatar.cmu.edu/admission </a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf39","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/experiencing-life-on-the-trading-floor","currSlug":"/media-center/experiencing-life-on-the-trading-floor","title":"Experiencing Life On The Trading Floor"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
