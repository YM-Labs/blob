Qatar, in particular, has published a National Health Strategy, in which cancer is one of the main concerns. In order to develop effective health-care strategies relating to cancer, countries across the Middle East will need to be at the forefront of integrated research initiatives. <br>\n <br>\n The next symposium will specifically focus on investigating breast cancer in the region and will take place in early 2016. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/HBKUs%20Qatar%20Biomedical%20Research%20Institute%20(QBRI)%20holds%20Symposium%20on%20Cancer%20Research%20in%20the%20Middle%20East.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">click here.</a></strong> &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf71","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbkus-qatar-biomedical-research-institute-qbri-holds-symposium-on-cancer-research-in-the-middle-east","currSlug":"/media-center/hbkus-qatar-biomedical-research-institute-qbri-holds-symposium-on-cancer-research-in-the-middle-east","title":"HBKU’s Qatar Biomedical Research Institute (QBRI) holds Symposium on Cancer Research in the Middle East"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
