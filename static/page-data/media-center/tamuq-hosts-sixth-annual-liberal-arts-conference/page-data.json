The world must reckon with the challenges of globalization, while seizing all of the opportunities it presents. We hope that this conference will provide us with answers, show us where to look for solutions, and educate us on what local entities can do to improve our lives as members of the global community.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The conference featured keynote addresses and panel sessions, and a slate of more than 70 speakers, including eight Texas A&amp;M at Qatar students and 24 presenters from Qatar. Other countries represented include the U.S., UK, Canada, Brunei, Japan, Germany, Poland, India, Bangladesh, Oman, Cyprus and the Netherlands. Conference participants also came from France, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore and Uruguay.<br>\n <br>\n Panel sessions were sponsored by The Initiative in Professional Ethics at Texas A&amp;M at Qatar and QAPCO.<br>\n <br>\n The Liberal Arts Program at Texas A&amp;M at Qatar hosts the conference each year to explore a wide variety of regional and global topics from a multidisciplinary perspective. Started in 2011 by faculty members Dr. Troy Bickham and Dr. Hassan Bashir, the event serves as a rich opportunity in Qatar for scholars in the social sciences, arts and humanities to engage with colleagues from around the world and to stimulate research and learning efforts. Collaborations from past conferences have led to several academic articles and several books.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/LAIC%20keynote%203-24.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Dr. C&#xE9;sar O.
