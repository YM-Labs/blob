Babar cited recent figures obtained from the Qatari Ministry of Labor, which &#x200E;placed non-GCC Arab expatriates in Qatar at 146,000, or 13 percent of the total workforce. <br>\n <br>\n The explanation for this downward trend in Arab workers, Babar argues, is simple economics. For GCC states rushing to employ workers in the early days of the burgeoning energy industry, employing workers from neighboring Arab countries made sense, given the shared cultural and linguistic connections. <br>\n <br>\n Over time, however, expanding numbers of non-working dependents meant Arab worker wages were not economically competitive, resulting in a shift to cheaper labor that could keep pace with the increasingly globalized and developed hydrocarbon industry.<br>\n <br>\n In conclusion, Babar said &#x201C;in Qatar, the state and society are extremely concerned about the &#x200E;demographic imbalance and the increasing presence of foreigners outnumbering them, and so &#x200E;really what they are looking for is to have their labor market needs met without any incremental &#x200E;increase to the population.&#x201D; &#x200E;<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Georgetown&#x2019;s website, please <a href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/424078.html#\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf75","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/the-shifting-demography-of-migrant-labor-in-qatar-discussed-at-georgetown","currSlug":"/media-center/the-shifting-demography-of-migrant-labor-in-qatar-discussed-at-georgetown","title":"The Shifting Demography of Migrant Labor in Qatar Discussed at Georgetown"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
