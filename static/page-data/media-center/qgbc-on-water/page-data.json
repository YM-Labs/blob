It&#x2019;s about using water more sustainably, rather than throwing it back down the drain,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n <p>One such example he outlined was to capture free water from air conditioning units. By storing leftover condensation, hundreds of liters of clean water can be produced.</p>\n <p>Mr Guilhem Joly, HSE Manager at Degremont Marubeni JV, detailed the little-known existence of a natural lagoon near the Doha West Sewage Treatment Plant. It has become a haven for birds and local flora that thrive on the constant flow of water produced by the facility.</p>\n <p>Subjects under deliberation included the introduction of foreign plant and animal species into the nation&#x2019;s environment, effects of desertification, and environmental costs of desalination.</p>\n <p>Dr Renee Richer, professor in biology at Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar, took a strong stance on the preservation of native species, in opposition to other panelists in favor of introducing new, exotic species to Qatar.</p>\n <p>&#x201C;I am not saying we can&#x2019;t have a lush green city, but we can do that while we promote local biodiversity and local species. This is all a part of sustainable development,&#x201D; commented Dr Richer, highlighting a number of native species that produce colorful blooms or edible fruit, including the common caper plant (known locally as <em>shafallah</em>) and the country&#x2019;s iconic Sidra tree.</p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf62","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qgbc-on-water","currSlug":"/media-center/qgbc-on-water","title":"QGBC on Water"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
