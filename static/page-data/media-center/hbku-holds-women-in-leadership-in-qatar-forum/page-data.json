Similar events are organized throughout the year in order to encourage students enrolled on the college&#x2019;s Juris Doctor (JD) graduate law degree to participate in debates across a range of issues in the areas of law and business. Although primarily held for the benefit of the students, the public are welcome to attend and participate in discussions.<br>\n <br>\n Four prominent women speakers shared their respective views on the challenges and opportunities faced by women leaders in Qatar today: Dr. Amira Sonbol, Professor of History at Georgetown University in Qatar, Dr. Amal Mohammed Al-Malki, Founding Dean of College of Humanities and Social Sciences at HBKU, Ms. Maryam Al-Bader, Legal Counsel at Qatar Foundation and Dr. Ghida Al Juburi, Legal Advisor and Secretary of the Board at Qatar Foundation. The highlights of the discussion emphasized how the empowerment of women is crucial if the region is to reach its full economic potential, and is at the heart of sustainable development. The discussion covered such topics as women in leadership from a historical context, portrayals of women in the media, and whether legally binding quotas for women should be introduced at board level.<br>\n <br>\n Amal Al-Malki, Founding Dean of HBKU&#x2019;s College of Humanities and Social Sciences, who was the first Qatari woman to be appointed as a faculty member within Education City, said: &#x201C;I am pleased to be part of this colloquium today which sheds light on a topic that is not regularly discussed in the news. Along with three other distinguished speakers, I would like to stress on women&#x2019;s role in leadership in Qatar and the Gulf and propose ways that can further promote our main objectives, such as: increase the percentage of women in leadership positions by raising awareness and creating leadership programs and work towards eliminating gender segregation to achieve equality in the workforce.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/WomeninLeadership_EN.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf53","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-holds-women-in-leadership-in-qatar-forum","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-holds-women-in-leadership-in-qatar-forum","title":"HBKU Holds “Women in Leadership in Qatar” Forum"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
