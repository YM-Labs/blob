Yet healthcare providers around the world are faced with critical challenges: delivering quality and affordable healthcare; financing the discovery of the best prevention techniques and interventions; and integrating this knowledge into public health and social policies.

Drawing on the most exciting innovations in these fields from around the world, the forums will identify practical options for policymakers which have the potential to positively impact upon these pressing challenges and improve healthcare for all. <br>\n <br>\n Professor Lord Darzi of Denham, Chairman for the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London and Executive Chair of WISH, said, &#x201C;Innovation plays a pivotal role in addressing global health challenges. If we can make it easier for countries to look after their people in innovative and accessible ways then we will all benefit, regardless of where we live or what kind of lifestyle we have. This is not limited to traditional providers of healthcare &#x2013; the best changes happen when other sectors contribute as well. By bringing together global policy makers, academics, scientists, researchers, NGOs, and business leaders, WISH will stimulate discussion and application of the most practical and innovative ideas that can be implemented around the globe.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n WISH supports the aims and ambitions of Qatar Foundation and Qatar National Vision 2030, and reinforces Qatar&#x2019;s pioneering role as an emerging centre for medical innovation.
