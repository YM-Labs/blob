The Malaysian-based organization holds the annual CTY School Holiday Camp, a joint venture between Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the National University of Malaysia with support from the Malaysian Prime Minister&#x2019;s office.<br>\n <br>\n This year Qatar Academy students Abdulaziz Al Marri, Al Jazi Al Thani, Usama Usman and Sahana Kanabar will be participating in the camp scheduled this December. <br>\n <br>\n PERMATApintar, which actually means Little Gems, was designed for talented students to experience academic enrichment to further push their potential. This purpose is parallel to QA&#x2019;s TAP which was launched in 2009 to support students with Talents, in Aptitude, Achievement, Creativity, Leadership and Potential.<br>\n <br>\n Program Coordinator Barbara Reynolds shares that for the last four years, TAP has been sending highly able students to C-MITES, a summer camp for talented elementary and middle school students based in Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh. It was this familiarity with student learning enrichment programs in addition to the school&#x2019;s ongoing discussion with JHU Center for Talented Youth Director Simeon Brodsky that helped seal the deal for this new endeavor.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/PERMATApintar.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf70","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/four-qatar-academy-students-invited-to-attend-gifted-learning-camp-in-malaysia","currSlug":"/media-center/four-qatar-academy-students-invited-to-attend-gifted-learning-camp-in-malaysia","title":"Four Qatar Academy Students Invited To Attend Gifted Learning Camp In Malaysia"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
