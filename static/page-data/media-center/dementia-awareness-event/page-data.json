The programme&#x2019;s activities included a series of talks by leading world experts in the study and care of dementia patients. Those in attendance heard first-hand accounts of caregivers who shared their perspectives and personal experiences on caring for patients with dementia.<br>\n <br>\n Egbert Schillings, CEO of WISH, said: &#x201C;Dementia is often overlooked amid more immediate health concerns. However, one out of three people die with dementia and all of us at some point will have the experience of a loved one being diagnosed with dementia. That is why we were delighted to co-host this community event with HMC, so as to give people a 360 degree view of dementia. We had a clinical perspective from both geriatrics and psychiatry, an ethical view thanks to the Qatar Islamic Cultural Center, and that of a caregiver. Everyone left deeply touched as well as enlightened. WISH is committed to helping advance the dementia agenda, both at a policy level and within the community.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dementia is an overall term that describes a condition when the brain is damaged by diseases, such as Alzheimer&#x2019;s or a series of strokes. Dementia includes a wide range of symptoms: deterioration in memory, thinking skills, and other symptoms severe enough to reduce a person&#x2019;s ability to perform everyday activities. Dementia is one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide; however, it is not a normal part of ageing. Dementia has physical, psychological, social and economic impact on caregivers, families and society which adds to the complexity of developing effective services.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_WISH%20Dementia_EN_PR-2016%2011%2002.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf47","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/dementia-awareness-event","currSlug":"/media-center/dementia-awareness-event","title":"Dementia Awareness Event"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
