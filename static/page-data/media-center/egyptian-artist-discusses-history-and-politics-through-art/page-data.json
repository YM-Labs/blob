Based on research and inquiry, he creates work that tackles notions of national, religious, and artistic identity through film, performance, and storytelling. <br>\n <br>\n Shawky&#x2019;s work has been described as art that frames contemporary culture through the lens of historical tradition and vice versa. <br>\n <br>\n A native of Alexandria, Egypt, where he still resides, Shawky uses a range of media to produce work that explores issues of history, religion, culture, and the effects of globalization in society in his home country and beyond.<br>\n <br>\n In photographs, installations, videos, and performances, he mines traditions of entertainment and performance through multilayered historical reconstructions that force viewers to navigate the territory of truth, myth, and stereotype. According to Shawky, film is the most effective method of communicating due to its time dimension. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Wael%20Shawky%20Post%20Event%20-%20EV%20final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf22","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/egyptian-artist-discusses-history-and-politics-through-art","currSlug":"/media-center/egyptian-artist-discusses-history-and-politics-through-art","title":"Egyptian Artist Discusses History and Politics Through Art"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
