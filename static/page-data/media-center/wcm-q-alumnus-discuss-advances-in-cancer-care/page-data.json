Dr. Baljevi&#x107;, who graduated from WCM-Q in 2010, is now Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, home to one of the leading cancer research centers in the US. <br>\n <img width=\"3924\" height=\"5171\" alt=\"null\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/WCM-Q%20GR%201.jpg\"><br>\n Dr. Baljevi&#x107; said: &#x201C;Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy behind non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it is estimated that there will be more than 30,000 newly diagnosed cases in the USA in 2016. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The good news is that the data show us that survival rates have improved a great deal but there is still room for more improvement. New and promising drugs are in the testing phase and I am excited to be involved in this research, which we hope will lead to improved patient outcomes.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Baljevi&#x107; was offered an Emiri scholarship in 2001 to come to Doha and finish high school at Qatar Academy, a member of Qatar Foundation. The scholarship was extended as a university academic scholarship for pre-medical and medical studies at WCM-Q, where he graduated from with honors in research. Since graduation Dr. Baljevi&#x107; has completed residency training in internal medicine at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York, and fellowship training in hematology and medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. <br>\n <br>\n Happily, Dr. Baljevi&#x107; is now looking forward to leading his first clinical trial which will investigate the efficacy of new drug combinations for treating multiple myeloma in patients who develop resistance to proteasome inhibitors. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Baljevi&#x107; added: &#x201C;Fulfilling my dream of being involved in development of novel therapies for patients with hematologic malignancies simply would not have been possible without the generous support I received from Qatar Foundation. Returning to Doha feels like coming home and I feel tremendously grateful for the truly life-changing opportunities Qatar has granted me.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/161010%20English%20Returning%20alumnus%20discusses%20advances%20in%20cancer%20care%20at%20WCM-Q%20Grand%20Rounds.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br>\n <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf68","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-alumnus-discuss-advances-in-cancer-care","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-alumnus-discuss-advances-in-cancer-care","title":"WCM-Q Alumnus Discuss Advances in Cancer Care"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
