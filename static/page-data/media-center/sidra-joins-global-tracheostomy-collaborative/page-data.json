There are currently 40 hospitals worldwide as part of the collaborative; Sidra is the first hospital in the Middle East to sign up as a member.<br>\n <br>\n The GTC is a non-profit organization where multi-disciplinary teams of healthcare professionals from around the world, collaborate and share knowledge to improve the quality of care for patients with a tracheostomy &#x2013; an incision in the windpipe made to relieve obstructions to breathing. Sidra&#x2019;s membership is being led by Dr Patrick Sheehan, Division Chief for Otolaryngology in the Department of Surgery.<br>\n <br>\n As a member of the GTC, Sidra&#x2019;s tracheostomy care team will have access to learning resources, case studies and a global database with information from member hospitals about the care of children who have tracheostomies. All data sharing is anonymized and patient confidentiality is not compromised.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Tracheostomy care is not always perfect in hospitals and adverse events can happen &#x2013; often due to human error. Simple interventions can make a big difference. The GTC was set up so that hospitals can work together to deliver and benchmark themselves to provide the best possible care. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;For example, if one hospital has a lower fatality rate and better success with managing the care of tracheostomy patients, other members can see what they are doing to incorporate this best practice into their hospital,&#x201D; said Dr Patrick Sheehan.<br>\n Dr Sheehan and the Sidra tracheostomy care team are planning to host a &#x2018;Pediatric Tracheotomy Care&#x2019; training workshop in February 2016 which will be accredited by Weill Cornell Medical College-Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n This will be an inter-disciplinary team workshop with talks from Sidra speakers on multi-disciplinary tracheostomy care and simulation workshops for surgeons, nurses and allied health personnel. More details on this will follow later in the year.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Sidra&#x2019;s website, please <strong><a href=\"http://www.sidra.org/sidra-joins-global-tracheostomy-collaborative/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.&#xA0;</strong><br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf40","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-joins-global-tracheostomy-collaborative","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-joins-global-tracheostomy-collaborative","title":"Sidra Joins Global Tracheostomy Collaborative"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
