Sheikha Athba Al Thani, adviser to the CEO of Qatar Diar-Vinci Construction and mother of a first-year CMU-Q student, delivered a keynote speech to the new students, their parents, faculty and staff. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%201-1-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1-1.jpg\" width=\"639\" height=\"426\"><br>\n Al Thani spoke of her own experience as the parent of a new CMU-Q student: &#x201C;I have seen the changes in my daughter&#x2019;s personality, the way that she has developed her independence in a very short time, and for that I thank Carnegie Mellon for their support. I would like to reassure you that your kids in are in the right hands.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Ilker Baybars, dean and CEO of CMU-Q, noted that several faculty members were at the dinner to welcome the new students: &#x201C;Throughout your studies, your professors will challenge you, support you and guide you. They are experts in their fields, and they are also dedicated educators. I encourage you to reach out, ask questions, and use the full resources we have available for you.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n There were 15 students admitted to the Class of 2021 through Early Decision, including Shouq Al-Khuzaei, who said, &#x201C;I feel very proud that I got accepted, and so are my parents. I really worked hard and it was very stressful, but it ended well.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n This is the second year that CMU-Q has offered Early Decision. A select group of students were invited to apply early, and decision letters were sent on December 15. For exceptional students who wish to study at CMU-Q, Early Decision is an opportunity to secure their place well in advance of the regular application deadline. <br>\n <br>\n CMU-Q will continue to accept applications for the fall semester until March 1, 2017. <br>\n <br>\n For more information on applying to Carnegie Mellon Qatar, please visit: <br>\n http://www.qatar.cmu.edu/admission<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf16","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/cmu-q-hosts-welcome-dinner-for-class-of-2021","currSlug":"/media-center/cmu-q-hosts-welcome-dinner-for-class-of-2021","title":"CMU-Q Hosts Welcome Dinner for Class of 2021"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
