Dentists should refer patients with gum disease to physicians to be tested for diabetes, and physicians should refer diabetes patients to dentist to help treat or prevent gum disease. Working in tandem like this will allow us to provide better overall care and identify some cases of diabetes that have been missed.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Coordinated by WCM-Q&#x2019;s Division of Continuing Professional Development, the workshop offered dentists, dental nurses, dental assistants and oral hygienists practical instruction on a wide range of issues related to periodontal disease. <br>\n <img width=\"6048\" height=\"4032\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo3.jpg\" alt=\"Photo3.jpg\"><br>\n These included how to screen and assess patients with periodontal disease, how to identify a tooth affected by periodontal disease, and strategies for coordinating successful treatment plans. There were also discussions about the prevalence of diabetes and its association with periodontal disease and a demonstration of techniques that can be used to address periodontal disease. <br>\n <br>\n Ms. Deema Al-Sheikhly, Director of Continuing Professional Development at WCM-Q, said: &#x201C;We are delighted to welcome such a well-qualified specialist periodontist as Dr. Algraffee to WCM-Q to offer dental health professionals in Qatar the most up-to-date practical guidance on periodontal screening and treatment. It is extremely important to take periodontal disease seriously, not only to protect oral health, but also to help identify undiagnosed diabetes.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/161106%20English%20Dentists%20can%20help%20catch%20undiagnosed%20diabetes,%20WCM-Q%20seminar%20hears.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf48","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/dental-role-in-diabetes-diagnosis","currSlug":"/media-center/dental-role-in-diabetes-diagnosis","title":"Dental Role in Diabetes Diagnosis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
