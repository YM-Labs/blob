Qatar believes that the rule of law is an important element in development and sustainability, and it&#x2019;s the desired path to build the world we want, and this cannot be achieved without the youth. Hence, Qatar has initiated this Forum, to bring the world&#x2019;s attention to the importance of youth participation in the decision making process.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Following the conclusion of the Forum, specially selected students will present their recommendations to the United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, which is taking place in Qatar from 12 &#x2013; 19 April 2015.
