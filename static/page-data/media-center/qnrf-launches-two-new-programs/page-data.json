QRLP aims to identify and nurture Qatar&#x2019;s finest homegrown science and research talent by providing high-quality training, practical experience in collaboration with prestigious universities and research institutions around the world, financial support, and a gateway to opportunity.<br>\n <br>\n Led by the capacity building team of QNRF, part of Qatar Foundation Research and Development (QF R&amp;D), the two tracks - QRLP-GSRA and QRLP-PDRA - are collectively designed to support candidates from graduate level, through postdoctoral studies, to their early careers, enabling them to play leading roles in advancing Qatar&#x2019;s ambitious research agenda. The alignment of these tracks with QRLP &#x2013; from which 52 young scientists and researchers have graduated in the eight years since its establishment &#x2013; is designed to produce human capital equipped to underpin and sustain the nation&#x2019;s research and innovation ecosystem. <br>\n <br>\n Through the competitive scholarships offered by QRLP-GSRA, outstanding graduate students will be supported to undertake research-based studies towards Master&#x2019;s and Doctoral degrees at approved institutions within and beyond Qatar. By promoting such studies, it aims to encourage talented Qatar-based students to pursue careers in research and provide them with high-quality training that intertwines with, and supports, the work of Qatar&#x2019;s research and academic community.<br>\n <br>\n The online proposal submission process for QRLP-GSRA is now open, with the deadline for submissions being May 6.
