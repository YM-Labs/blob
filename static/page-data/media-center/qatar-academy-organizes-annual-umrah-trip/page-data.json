Touring around Mecca and Medina, the students noticed the improved facilities and services that made the trip much easier than how it used to be before introducing these creative solutions. Such observations made the students value and realize the importance of inventions and the role of individual in building their society.<br>\n <br>\n The above example, says Ibrahim, clearly reflects the main goal of the trip which is to provide opportunities for students to apply what they have learned from the IB&#x2019;s Areas of Interaction into their own lives. Under the MYP, these Areas of Interaction help the students in understanding the different subjects &#x2013; for instance history and science during this trip &#x2013; as an interrelated area of discipline meant to enrich their knowledge and experience. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Qatar Academy has been organizing the Umrah trip for years and we are seeing a continued increase in the numbers of registered students,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We have a significant number of Muslim students and providing this trip will help them meet their religious needs. It is an excellent opportunity to visit historical sites and nourish the good relationships they have built with their chaperon teachers&#x201D;.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf51","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-academy-organizes-annual-umrah-trip","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-academy-organizes-annual-umrah-trip","title":"Qatar Academy Organizes Annual Umrah Trip"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
