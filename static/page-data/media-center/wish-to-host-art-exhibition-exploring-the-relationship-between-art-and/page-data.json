The exhibition will also include a display of artwork produced by refugee Rohingya children, as part of a project by UK-based humanitarian charity, Save the Children.\nDuley’s indoor collection – ‘Iraq: An Open Wound’ – depicts healthcare and rehabilitation efforts in Mosul by health charity, EMERGENCY, while his outdoor exhibit – ‘Disability and Armed Conflict’ - gives insight into the lives of people with disabilities during armed conflict. These stories have special meaning for Duley, who lost both legs and his left arm after stepping on an explosive device in Afghanistan in 2011, whilst on photographic assignment to document the horrors of war.\nMr. Duley said: “The price I paid for doing my work was huge, but the gift I received in return, it’s equal – I understand these stories in a way no other photographer could.”\nHe stressed the importance of photography as an “honest’’ art form that permits insight into other’s worlds, and said: “There is no point in taking a photograph if I do not do all I can to make sure the whole world sees it. That is where my duty lies.”\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/7pFRfRD872zYLhbSvyoBmV/2d39a83da9fff3ff6641b09bbf1c5c0f/Image_3_-_WISH_art_exhibit.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3 - WISH art exhibit\">\nSultana Afdhal, CEO, WISH, explained how the exhibition grew from the organization’s 2018 report, ‘Healthcare in Conflict Settings’, which recommended increasing public awareness through events and educational activities.\n“By bringing the exhibition to the heart of the artistic community in Qatar, we hope to raise awareness of the devastating effects of war and violence, particularly on the most vulnerable during times of conflict: our children.\n“We are thrilled to be showcasing Giles Duley’s photography and we are delighted to give people the opportunity to learn about some of the tremendous work that Save the Children is doing with the child victims of the Rohingya crisis. We are striving to involve every part of the community in Qatar. We encourage people to come and participate in our workshops and talks at the Fire Station, and to use the exhibition to enrich our perspectives through this thought-provoking exhibition.”\nThe exhibition features a full program of events for schools, universities, healthcare professionals, and art and photography enthusiasts. Activities open to the public include an art therapy session organized by members of the Save The Children team working with refugees in Cox’s Bazar on October 2 from 6-8pm, and a photography workshop hosted by Giles Duley on October 10 from 6-8pm. Duley will also lead a public talk detailing his personal story at the Fire Station Cinema on October 8, from 6-8pm.\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/Ai32bbedZLQ4gCKnsgEb8/8901e99273e142cfd7cb9af62e3c2040/Image_1_-_WISH_art_exhibit.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1 - WISH art exhibit\"></p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"ayTwREShoGU6t0pQ7jAi2","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-to-host-art-exhibition-exploring-the-relationship-between-art-and","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-to-host-art-exhibition-exploring-the-relationship-between-art-and","title":"WISH To Host Art Exhibition Exploring The Relationship Between Art And Health In Conflict Zones"}}}
