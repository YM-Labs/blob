His Excellency Engineer Essa bin Hilal Al-Kuwari, president of the Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation, &quot;KAHRAMAA,&quot; was honorary chair of the conference, which looked at the importance of power electronics and renewable energy resources integration for the world, and explored the viability of these advanced technologies. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Haitham Abu-Rub, conference chair and chair of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Program at Texas A&amp;M at Qatar, said the conference was a great opportunity to promote Qatar and its high research and education activities. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/049_RC44708-24.jpg\" alt=\"049_RC44708.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n &#x201C;Well-known scientists and researchers from almost 25 countries had the chance to visit Qatar and to take part in the conference rich technical, industrial and social activities,&#x201D; Abu-Rub said. &#x201C;Attendees were engaged in discussions of ongoing and future research toward next-generation power electronics, power energy and smart grid. The event was very instrumental in drawing the attention of top world scientists to outcomes of Qatar&#x2019;s great research efforts. They were able to see the products of the QNRF research being conducted in the Smart Grid Center at Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar.&#x201D;<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/023_RC81443-24.jpg\" alt=\"023_RC81443.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n In his opening remarks Dr. Abdul Sattar Al-Taie, QNRF Executive Director, said, &#x201C;Constructing a power grid that not only supports and strengthens economic growth, but also facilitates the development and deployment of renewable energy resources, represents an important technological priority. Indeed, bringing Qatar&#x2019;s conventional power grid into the era of smart grids is in line with the nation&#x2019;s strategic orientation, as such a transformation will lead to higher energy efficiency and lower carbon emissions. QNRF has played a major role in supporting complex and multidisciplinary research fields addressed by this conference, and I call upon our research community in Qatar to reap the fruits of these research projects in order to achieve the goals and objectives of QNV 2030 and transform Qatar&#x2019;s economy from carbon-based to knowledge-based.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The conference brought together leading scientists, researchers and stakeholders from international and national research institutions, universities and industry to exchange information on medium- to long-term research and the future challenges of power electronics, smart grid and renewable energies. Attendees engaged in discussions of ongoing and future research toward next-generation power electronics, renewable energy technologies and applications, which organizers said they hope would lead to research collaboration opportunities among participants.<br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf91","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/tamuq-hosts-electronics-and-engineering-conference","currSlug":"/media-center/tamuq-hosts-electronics-and-engineering-conference","title":"TAMUQ Hosts Electronics and Engineering Conference"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
