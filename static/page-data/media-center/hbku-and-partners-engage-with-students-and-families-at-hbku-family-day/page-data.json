The Universities allowed parents and students to interact and speak about learning both inside and outside the classroom.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Family Day is not only a great way for families to learn about their student&#x2019;s day to day lives here in Education City,&#x201D; said Melissa Winter Jan, Assistant Director of Campus Life at HBKU, &#x201C;but it is also an opportunity for students to further introduce to their families their community within Education City. With events that illustrate the academic exploration and knowledge growth that our universities are known for, and recreational activities that allow students and their families to create wonderful memories here together, this is one of our most widely enjoyed events.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/140205%20-%20HBKU%20and%20Partners%20Engage%20with%20Students%20and%20Families%20at%20HBKU%20Family%20Day.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf28","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-and-partners-engage-with-students-and-families-at-hbku-family-day","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-and-partners-engage-with-students-and-families-at-hbku-family-day","title":"HBKU and Partners Engage with Students and Families at HBKU Family Day"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
