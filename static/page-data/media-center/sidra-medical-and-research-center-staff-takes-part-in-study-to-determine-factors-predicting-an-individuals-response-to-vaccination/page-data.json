The study was carried out on 63 of the volunteers and identified both the baseline characteristics of vaccine-induced coherent changes as well as individual heterogeneity (before vaccination) in response to the vaccination.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Vaccination is one of the most powerful tools we have in the fight against disease, so understanding how different factors can affect the efficacy of vaccines is very important,&#x201D; said Dr Wang. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;This study shows that there are significant variations among healthy individuals in response to a given vaccine at molecular, cellular and protein level and determining the existing baseline of an individual&#x2019;s immune status is a strong predictor of his or her response to vaccination. Understanding these factors is key to developing our understanding of the immune system and the ways in which we can harness it to prevent and treat disease.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story on Sidra&apos;s website, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sidra.org/sidra-medical-and-research-center-staff-takes-part-in-study-to-determine-factors-predicting-an-individuals-response-to-vaccination/\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf50","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-medical-and-research-center-staff-takes-part-in-study-to-determine-factors-predicting-an-individuals-response-to-vaccination","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-medical-and-research-center-staff-takes-part-in-study-to-determine-factors-predicting-an-individuals-response-to-vaccination","title":"Sidra Medical And Research Center Staff Takes Part in Study to Determine Factors Predicting an Individual’s Response to Vaccination"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
