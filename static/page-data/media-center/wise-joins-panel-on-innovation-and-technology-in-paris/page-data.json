They considered the pressure in the private sector to create a culture of innovation, and ways to ensure equitable global access to the most innovative technologies. The panelists also explored how to avoid creating technological gaps among countries at different stages of their development. <br>\n <br>\n The IEFA&#x2019;s conferences bring together senior government leaders and heads of state, specialists, union leaders, representatives of private and public sectors, academics, and civil society to discuss issues, share experiences, and provide access to information. The IEFA calls for open and unrestricted dialogue on the complex issues of the globalization process, focusing on the issue of widening inequality. The Conference of Paris considers the role of Europe, and the need for a globalization that is more inclusive, more balanced, and more humane.<br>\n <br>\n WISE was established in 2009 under the leadership of Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Chairperson of Qatar Foundation. Its participation in the Paris event, in line with QF&#x2019;s ethos of inspiring positive change in local communities and beyond, aims to help build the future of education. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_WISE_IEFAConferenceofParis_PressRelease_EN_20171220.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf52","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-joins-panel-on-innovation-and-technology-in-paris","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-joins-panel-on-innovation-and-technology-in-paris","title":"WISE Joins Panel on Innovation and Technology in Paris"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
