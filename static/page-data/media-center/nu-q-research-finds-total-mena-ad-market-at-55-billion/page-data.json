And a recent study by Northwestern University in Qatar (NU-Q) reports that that transition is also causing a slow expansion of ad revenue in the MENA region. <br>\n <img width=\"875\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Enroll-Mixed%20Views%20on%20Internet,%20Media%20Freedom.jpg\" alt=\"Survey:Mixed Views on Internet, Media Freedom.jpg\"><br>\n The study, Media Industries in the Middle East, 2016 , which was conducted by NU-Q in cooperation with the Doha Film Institute (DFI), reports that over the past five years, the industry has shown a weak but stable growth in the MENA region. In 2015, the total ad market in the region was worth an estimated $5.5 billion (USD) in net advertising revenues. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201D;Disruption across the media industries largely driven by new, digital developments and the displacement of traditional media outlets, is the nature of advertising revenue globally and in the region,&#x201D; said Everette E. Dennis, dean and CEO of Northwestern University in Qatar. &#x201C;This report provides decision-makers with insights, based on hard data, that suggest how technological developments have &#x2013; and will &#x2013; influence the trajectory of media related industries, including advertising.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The report found that digital still represents only 10 percent of ad spend, compared to 30&#x2013;35 percent spend on print. Collectively, MENA countries trail other regions in innovation and adoption of new technologies (e.g., limited digital measurement, programmatic buying, and non-advertising forms of marketing). As a result, many of the opportunities of digital advertising have yet to be realized, despite high levels of digital consumption in the region.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Advertising%20Release%20-%20EV%20final.pdf\"><strong> click here.</strong></a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf48","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-research-finds-total-mena-ad-market-at-55-billion","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-research-finds-total-mena-ad-market-at-55-billion","title":"NU-Q Research Finds Total MENA Ad Market at $5.5 Billion"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
