Type 2 diabetes is generally related to lifestyle and affects around 17 percent of people in Qatar whereas type 1 is a complex autoimmune disease. Along with these most common variations of the condition, Prof Hussain also outlined other types of the condition, including neonatal, mitochondrial, syndromic and MODY (Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young). <br>\n <br>\n He went on to describe the most effective management of the various types of diabetes and how accurate diagnosis of the specific variation affects the medication and control of the disease. <br>\n <br>\n The lecture was accredited locally by the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners-Accreditation Department (QCHP-AD) and internationally by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME). <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Stephen Atkin, professor of medicine at WCM-Q, said: &#x201C;Professor Hussain is an acknowledged expert on childhood diabetes and a renowned clinician and researcher. His talk has been truly valuable for healthcare professionals and his work in the laboratory will hopefully continue to bring further enlightenment to the topic.&#x201D; <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf91","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-grand-rounds-discusses-childhood-diabetes","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-grand-rounds-discusses-childhood-diabetes","title":"WCM-Q Grand Rounds Discusses Childhood Diabetes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
