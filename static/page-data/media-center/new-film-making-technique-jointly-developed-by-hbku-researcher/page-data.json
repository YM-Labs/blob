For example, the new technique will maintain the structure of underlying objects in portraits, which are usually difficult to reproduce because abnormalities in people&#x2019;s faces are easily spotted.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;In images like portraits it&#x2019;s very important to maintain the structure of facial features, and current approaches will corrupt them. We can now more accurately capture the strokes of an original painting than other techniques,&#x201D; Dr Elgharib said.<br>\n <br>\n An example of the new technique can be seen in the film Loving Vincent, due for release in September. The world&#x2019;s first full-length painted animation, the film tells the story of painter Vincent Van Gogh, and will be made from 62,450 hand-painted frames completed by 85 painters in Van Gogh&#x2019;s style.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Current approaches for generating painted movies are manual and they are very expensive in both time and production cost. The total production budget of Loving Vincent is between 5 to 15 million euros. Our approach, however, is fully automated and much cheaper. We just need some servers and we&#x2019;re ready to go,&#x201D; said Dr Elgharib.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160712_QCRI%20Film-Paintings%20Story_Final_English.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br>\n <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10qf69","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/new-film-making-technique-jointly-developed-by-hbku-researcher","currSlug":"/media-center/new-film-making-technique-jointly-developed-by-hbku-researcher","title":"New Film-Making Technique Jointly Developed by HBKU Researcher"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
