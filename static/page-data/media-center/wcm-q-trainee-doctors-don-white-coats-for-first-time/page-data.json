This year, the Medical Program has admitted 40 students of 14 different nationalities. In total, 35 percent of the students joining the Medical Program are Qatari nationals. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo3.jpg\" alt=\"Photo1.JPG\" height=\"906\" width=\"1800\"><br>\n The ceremony also marks the culmination of WCM-Q&#x2019;s Orientation Program, which introduces students joining the college&#x2019;s Foundation, Pre-medical and Medical Programs to their new classmates, faculty and the facilities at WCM-Q. <br>\n Addressing the audience at the event, Dr. Javaid Sheikh, Dean of WCM-Q, said: &#x201C;It gives me great pleasure to welcome all of our new students to WCM-Q and to present to them their very first white coat and stethoscope, both of which are such powerful symbols of our profession and the practice of medicine.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo4.jpg\" alt=\"Photo4.jpg\" height=\"1237\" width=\"1800\"><br>\n The Class of 2020 will now spend four years training in all aspects of medicine from faculty members based in Qatar and also from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.
