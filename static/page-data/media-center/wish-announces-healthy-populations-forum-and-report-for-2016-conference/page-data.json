By discussing case studies based on community and employer-led initiatives, healthcare systems and city-wide approaches, the paper will lay out a framework for a population health management strategy that will translate into actionable policy recommendations.<br>\n <br>\n Among the topics the report will cover are the significance of technology and innovation in enhancing the health of populations, in both low and high-income countries. It will shed light on how technology has transformed the way healthcare is delivered in certain countries, while identifying possible interventions that lead to short and long-term impact. <br>\n <br>\n The WISH 2016 Summit will feature seven groundbreaking research forums that highlight and address some of the world&#x2019;s most pressing healthcare challenges. In addition to Healthy Populations, the forums will generate interdisciplinary, evidence-based reports on topics including &#x2018;Precision Medicine&#x2019;, &#x2018;Economic Benefits of Investing in Health&#x2019;, &#x2018;Cardiovascular Disease&#x2019;, &#x2018;Accountable Car&#x2019;, &#x2018;Autism&#x2019;, and &#x2018;Behavioral Insights&#x2019;. <br>\n <br>\n WISH will also report on its ongoing impact locally and globally on issues previously highlighted at the Summit, such as diabetes and patient safety. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/16%2003%2016_Healthy%20Populations_En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a><br>\n &#xA0;</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf92","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-announces-healthy-populations-forum-and-report-for-2016-conference","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-announces-healthy-populations-forum-and-report-for-2016-conference","title":"WISH Announces Healthy Populations Forum and Report for 2016 Conference"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
