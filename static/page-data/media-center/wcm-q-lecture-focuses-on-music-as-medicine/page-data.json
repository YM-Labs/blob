Other uses of the therapy include as a complementary treatment for conditions like high blood pressure, which has been shown to benefit from certain types of music; and as an intensive treatment for anxiety and respiratory disorders. <br>\n <br>\n Music therapy has also been shown to help people with a stutter, with Dr. Kotoub explaining that they may be able to sing normally but have difficulty speaking, as different parts of the brain are responsible for each action, so music therapists attempt to &#x2018;trick&#x2019; the brain into using the singing part for speech.<br>\n <br>\n He also explained why music can be a profound pain reliever. &#x201C;It has been shown that playing music during and after surgery reduces the amount of pain killers that are needed and improves the outcome of the surgery,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Music increases dopamine which will have an impact on your vascular system. So, you get more blood coming in to the area that has had surgery and the wound will heal faster. This is the science behind what is happening.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Music has also been proved to help in creating subcortical links between damaged brain centers, such as after strokes, and that improves a lot of patients&#x2019; lives and mobility skills.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/181105%20English%20Music%20as%20medicine.pdf\">here</a></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf11","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-lecture-focuses-on-music-as-medicine","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-lecture-focuses-on-music-as-medicine","title":"WCM-Q Lecture Focuses on Music as Medicine"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
