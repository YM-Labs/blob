RHEEM could then help the airline&#x2019;s engineers to use this information to schedule extra flight capacity with data stored separately on multiple platforms. Qatar Airways has agreed to test the technology.<br>\n <br>\n Hospitals could use the application to improve patient monitoring. For example, doctors might need to gather information about patients (whose information is typically stored in a database) who have received similar prescriptions, information usually stored in text files.<br>\n <br>\n The oil industry could also use RHEEM to analyse structured and unstructured data to improve efficiency. During an exploration phase, for instance, data has to be acquired, integrated and analyzed in order to predict if a reservoir will be profitable.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/rheem%20architecture.png\" alt=\"rheem architecture.png\" height=\"619\" width=\"643\"><br>\n RHEEM allows users to easily specify these tasks with easy-to-use interfaces, provides developers with opportunities to optimise performance in different ways and can run on any data-processing platform, such as PostgreSQL, Spark or GraphChi.<br>\n <br>\n The software has been presented to scientists at leading international conferences including SIGMOD, VLDB and EDBT.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160622_QCRI%20Rheem%20App_Final_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf80","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qcri-at-hamad-bin-khalifa-university-launches-rheem-big-data-app","currSlug":"/media-center/qcri-at-hamad-bin-khalifa-university-launches-rheem-big-data-app","title":"QCRI At Hamad bin Khalifa University Launches RHEEM Big Data App"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
