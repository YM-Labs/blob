Dr. Kholode Al-Obaidli, Sidra Medicine&#x2019;s Chief Learning Officer, shared her thoughts on how organizations can mobilize progress and empower women. Some of her most poignant advice centered on harnessing personal passion to drive achievement and growth and not being afraid to employ emotional intelligence as a leadership tool.<br>\n <br>\n Speaking at the event, Dr. Al Obaidli said, &#x201C;Our goal is to make Sidra Medicine an employer of choice for women and we have taken a number of steps to reflect this ambition by recognizing the importance of working women. With more than 66 per cent of the workforce at Sidra Medicine being female, our focus for this year will be on helping our employees achieve a healthy work-life balance. Studies have shown that organizations that embrace such policies worldwide are more effective, with improved productivity and retention. We want to lead by example in Qatar, by listening to the needs of our employees and enabling them to perform at their best in a supportive environment.&#x201D;<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Sidra_20Medicine_20-_20Intl_20Womens_20Day.2-24.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Sidra Medicine has already implemented several policies to gain recognition as an employer of choice for women. These include enhanced maternity leave and the ability to return to work part time on full time pay to encourage retention, among other benefits. Further policies around a flexible working framework and special leave policies for domestic emergencies are being developed this year. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We are committed to creating a workplace that supports women in reaching their full potential, be it through comprehensive learning and development programs or policies that celebrate the special needs of new mothers and families,&#x201D; added Dr. Al Obaidli. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Sidra_20Medicine_20Marks_20International_20Women_27s_20Day_20ENG_208_20Mar_202018_20FINAL.pdf\">here</a>.&#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf53","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-medicine-an-employer-of-choice-for-women","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-medicine-an-employer-of-choice-for-women","title":"Sidra Medicine an Employer of Choice for Women"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
