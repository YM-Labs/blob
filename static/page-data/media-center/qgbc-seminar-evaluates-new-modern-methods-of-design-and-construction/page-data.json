Ultimately, this approach seeks to manage and improve construction processes with minimum cost and maximum value.<br>\n <br>\n Alongside an overview of Lean Construction in the Middle East, the seminar also looked at prefabrication of the Middle East market and the future procurement and construction delivery in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n Luai M El-Sabek, PE, PMP, who has over 15 years&#x2019; experience as a Consultant and Project Manager in signature mega projects in Qatar, highlighted how a staggering QR300 million could be saved by adopting Lean Construction in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n Sabek said, &#x201C;With successful implementation of Resilience Lean Construction, projects no longer have to be over budget, delayed or frustrating to the client and other stakeholders.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/25_2_2014_QGBC%20Modren%20Methods%20of%20Design%20PR_En_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf66","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qgbc-seminar-evaluates-new-modern-methods-of-design-and-construction","currSlug":"/media-center/qgbc-seminar-evaluates-new-modern-methods-of-design-and-construction","title":"QGBC Seminar Evaluates New Modern Methods of Design and Construction"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
