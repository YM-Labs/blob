They take place every Tuesday evening at the Faculty&#x2019;s premises with a different module presented each week by experienced practitioners.<br>\n <br>\n The training program combines theory and practical knowledge on Public Policy and Islam through case studies. Areas such as poverty alleviation, corruption, international development, Islamic governance, and leadership in policy making are examined through the application of Islam and public policy. The primary objective is to introduce social and economic challenges from an Islamic-based perspective. <br>\n <br>\n In the first session held on 19 November, Coordinator, Dr. Evren Tok, framed a key question, &#x2018;How to think like a policy analyst?&#x2019; Dr. Tok said, &#x201C;Thinking like a policy analyst requires more than technical knowledge. In fact, values play an important role in every stage of policy process. This method is based on putting the Islamic values as the basis of policy making and analysis, whether in defining the problems, setting priorities, or any other policy making activity.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Islamic values are known as &quot;Maqasid Al-Shariah&quot;, these are purposes and objectives of Islamic law. They put the well-being of the human at the center of policy making and place basic rights, needs and necessities as a core issue.&#x201D; The nine week-long series will finish with a closing ceremony and a poster session by the participants.<br>\n <br>\n The Master Program of Arts in Public Policy in Islam is a multidisciplinary program designed to respond to contemporary social and economic challenges from an Islamic-based perspective. Public Policy in Islam Program conducts this workshop in collaboration with the Executive Training and Consultation Unit at QFIS under the management of Professor Dr. El Sayed El Siefy, the Associate Professor of Finance and the Director of the Unit, and under the administration and operation of Mr. Ezzeddine A.
