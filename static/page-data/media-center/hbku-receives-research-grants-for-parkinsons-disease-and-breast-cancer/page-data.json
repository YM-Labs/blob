Several patented inventions have emerged from research carried out in the UK and the Gulf region, and his discoveries have offered many new opportunities for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools.<br>\n <br>\n The second grant awarded to the department is for research led by Dr Imed Gallouzi, Professor of Life Science at HBKU&#x2019;s College of Science and Engineering, as Lead Principal Investigator, in collaboration with Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar&#x2019;s Dr Lotfi Chouchane as Principal Investigator. <br>\n <br>\n The QNRF-backed project will expand on Dr Gallouzi&#x2019;s initial research and work to identify novel protein players in promoting the death of breast cancer cells and tumors. If successful, the project will offer key insight into combating the disease and aid doctors and practitioners treating breast cancer patients.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/150711_HBKU%20faculty%20receive%20QNRF%20funding%20toward%20Parkinson-s%20disease%20and%20breast%20cancer%20research.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong>.</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf28","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-receives-research-grants-for-parkinsons-disease-and-breast-cancer","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-receives-research-grants-for-parkinsons-disease-and-breast-cancer","title":"HBKU Receives Research Grants for Parkinson’s Disease and Breast Cancer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
