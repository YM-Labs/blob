LHSN is an initiative of WISH that brings together healthcare leaders and industry experts to identify and discuss areas of improvement in healthcare systems. The webinar was led by Dr. Matthew Harris, Clinical Senior Lecturer in Public Health Medicine, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London; and Ms. Hannah Patel, Policy Fellow, Centre for Health Policy, Institute for Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London.<br>\n <br>\n It is well known that it takes over 17 years for healthcare innovations to be put into practice.The popular question is, &#x2018;why does it take so long?&#x2019;The WISH webinar explored the barriers and enablers to the successful diffusion of innovation, drawing on specific case studies as well as large-scale quantitative and qualitative research.It also provided advice to policymakers and frontline caregivers on how to harness the benefits of innovation in healthcare.<br>\n <br>\n The webinar highlighted research conducted since the launch of the Global Diffusion of Healthcare Innovation (GDHI) program in 2012. GDHI is a research program funded by Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF), which explores how innovation spreads between countries. It also looks at how innovations could be adapted to align with the needs of frontline healthcare workers from around the world.<br>\n <br>\n The results of the eight research case studies show four critical enablers of innovation diffusions across different countries. The first one is vision, strategy and leadership; a clear target to work towards and a clear need for innovation. The second is an agency; a body committed to the implementation of the innovation. The third is specific funding for research, development and diffusion of an innovation, and, lastly, communication channels and networks across the healthcare industry and with the public. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD-EC-WISH_LHSN_Webinar-EN-PR-2017%2003%2002%20EN.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28qf18","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-hosts-webinar-on-diffusion-of-healthcare-innovation","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-hosts-webinar-on-diffusion-of-healthcare-innovation","title":"WISH Hosts Webinar on Diffusion of Healthcare Innovation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
