WISH 2018 will take place at the Qatar National Convention Centre (QNCC) from November 13-14.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%201%20(3)-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"637\"><br>\n Viral hepatitis, a disease of the liver caused by an infection that results in the death of around 1.34 million people globally per year, will be investigated by an international group of experts in the field of infectious diseases in the months leading up to November&#x2019;s summit. The group&#x2019;s findings will be presented in a report that will be published in time for WISH 2018 and will be discussed in depth during a panel session to be held during the prestigious event. The aim is for the report to produce policy recommendations that can have a positive impact on the management of viral hepatitis and support global efforts being made to prevent transmission &#x2013; particularly in vulnerable populations. <br>\n <br>\n The WISH research group is being led by Professor Margaret Hellard, Deputy Director, Burnet Institute, which is based in Melbourne, Australia. Professor Hellard boasts more than two decades of clinical and research expertise, including using new technologies, such as social media, for health promotion and prevention interventions. <br>\n <br>\n As with previous summits, WISH 2018 will once again gather the world&#x2019;s healthcare leaders at QNCC to highlight and address some of the world&#x2019;s most pressing healthcare challenges. WISH, which hosts its showcase Doha summit biennially, has quickly established itself as a major highlight on the global healthcare calendar for the thousands of high-level policy-makers, academics, and professionals in attendance. It has also become a key platform for the dissemination of healthcare innovation and best practices. <br>\n <br>\n WISH 2018 will feature nine groundbreaking research forums, each led by an internationally renowned expert in their field. Between them, the forums will highlight and address some of the world&#x2019;s most pressing challenges across topics that cover medical, ethical, technological, and humanitarian aspects of healthcare.<br>\n <br>\n WISH 2018 will also feature reports on its ongoing impact locally and globally on issues previously highlighted at the summit, such as autism, and will feature an increased array of community-based events across Qatar. Examples of healthcare innovation in action will be presented within &#x2018;The WISH Hub&#x2019; &#x2013; an interactive space that will showcase novel healthcare products, host informal discussions, and provide hands-on experience of technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/03-02-2018%20WISH%20VH%20Forum%20Press%20Release%20EN.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf83","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-2018-to-discuss-eliminating-viral-hepatitis","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-2018-to-discuss-eliminating-viral-hepatitis","title":"WISH 2018 to Discuss Eliminating Viral Hepatitis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
