The pharmacies offer medications relevant to the clinics on the same floor. However, patients requiring special compounded medications will be directed to the main pharmacy on the ground floor.<br>\n <br>\n Patients or parents can also receive a text message when it is their turn to collect medication. The service is part of a new in-house developed application called Saffara, which is directly connected with a patient&#x2019;s electronic medical record system &#x2013; ensuring confidentiality, efficiency and saving time. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Sidra%20Pharmacy%20staff-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n Chief Operating Officer, Morag Gates said, &#x201C;With over 47 clinics and services,there has been a significant increase in the number of patients we care for at the OPC. This can average to nearly 2,000 patients per week. Improving our patients&#x2019; experience is vitally important to us, so we increased the number of pharmacies to four. Patients can now get their prescriptions from the same floor as where they receive care from their doctors. Coupled with the launch of Saffara, we have drastically reduced wait times at the pharmacy by nearly 75 per cent!&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The Saffara app has also allowed for patients to comfortably wait in the caf&#xE9; or from home for their medications to be prepared or refilled - all without the stress of having to worry that they may miss their turn. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;As Sidra expands its services, we have a firm commitment to ensuring that we listen to our patients concerns and the feedback of our staff. This allows us to continually put in place measures to ensure that we provide safe, patient and family focused care for the women and children of Qatar. The additional pharmacies have made a huge difference to the experience of our patients. I am immensely pleased and proud of our staff and their collaborative efforts to improve the care of our patients. And a special mention to the brains behind Saffara, Dr. Ben Lee and the Project Imagine team who brought it to life. Together, we have been able to showcase how teamwork, care and innovation can transform lives,&#x201D; concluded Ms. Gates.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/2017_10_08%20%20-%20New%20pharmacies%20reduce%20wait%20times%20by%2075-25%20at%20Sidra%20-%20ENG%20v0.3.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf65","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/waiting-time-down-75-as-sidra-adds-extra-pharmacies","currSlug":"/media-center/waiting-time-down-75-as-sidra-adds-extra-pharmacies","title":"Waiting Time Down 75% as Sidra Adds Extra Pharmacies"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
