The exhibition will remain open until 27 July 2017 at Mohammed Bin Jassim House in Msheireb Museums.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;This student-led project is a crucial, assessed component of the master&#x2019;s programme, which seeks to bridge the gap between museum theory and practice. The project affords our students &#x2013; who are undergoing rigorous graduate training to further professionalise or to enter the museum profession, in Qatar or abroad &#x2013; the unique opportunity to implement knowledge acquired on the programme, working collaboratively with a museum. The staff&#x2019;s dedication to the project, and their commitment to student learning and to their continuous professional development, has been pivotal in making the project a mutually rewarding and successful experience,&quot; said Dr Sam Evans, Director of UCL Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n Over the last few months, this year&#x2019;s group of students have had the opportunity to explore and conduct curatorial research around Msheireb Museums&#x2019; collection of objects and oral history archives, curating a temporary exhibition that complements the scope of the permanent galleries in the Mohammed Bin Jassim House. <br>\n <br>\n Located within the Heritage Quarter, a historic area of Msheireb Downtown Doha, Mohammed Bin Jassim House is one of four heritage houses which has been restored to create a trusted cultural destination that enriches the community. Rooted in history, these reconstructed buildings and gallery spaces allow the community to engage with significant aspects of Qatar&#x2019;s past and memories of life before the country&#x2019;s rapid economic development.<br>\n <br>\n The increase in economic wealth and employment opportunities in Qatar led to a growth in foreign populations from countries such as India, Pakistan, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, and the Philippines from the 1970s. Msheireb became the popular destination for shopping, and a hub for small local community between the 1980s and 2000s &#x2013; long before the wider &#x201C;mall culture&#x201D; spread throughout the country &#x2013; and allowed the meeting of diverse cultures, tastes, languages, and traditions. <br>\n <br>\n &#x2018;Back to Msheireb&#x2019; presents a selection of found objects and oral histories of <br>\n personal memories of this former commercial neighborhood through an installation of pop-up stores inspired by the eclectic and often quirky character of this part of Doha. <br>\n <br>\n Visitors are encouraged to share their photos of the exhibition on social media using #UCLQurates #BacktoMsheireb.
