And the successful conclusion of season nine&#x2014;which saw participants originating from countries across the region, including Qatar, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, and Kuwait&#x2014;demonstrated that building better science can break down political barriers. <br>\n <br>\n Mohammed Al-Jefairi, from Qatar, placed fourth last year with his innovative project, &#x2018;Deaf Interactive Robotic Teacher.&#x2019; The invention uses a robotic hand to communicate in Arabic sign language, with the goal of further developing the program to speak and recognize multiple sign languages. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;My season&#x2014;season nine&#x2014;featured participants from a number of the blockading countries, including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain,&#x201D; Mohammed explained. &#x201C;It was difficult to accept what was happening at the time. But, I believe, we can leave politics behind, and that science and research &#x2014;or any activity, such as sports or education&#x2014;can cross borders.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image2%20(19)-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image2 (19).JPG\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n &#x201C;Qatar Foundation, in particular Stars of Science, has given me&#x2014;as well as all of the contestants on the show&#x2014;the opportunity to fulfill my goals and to unlock my potential as an innovator. And I want to help give back to this country, to help make Qatar great.&#x201D; Following the conclusion of Stars of Science, Mohammed launched Creativity Qatar, a training platform designed to help young people across the nation become successful entrepreneurs.<br>\n <br>\n The season finale of Stars of Science was filmed in Oman, in collaboration with the Oman Technology Fund, which forms part of a wider partnership with QF, and featured finalists from Qatar, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;At Qatar Foundation, we are committed to the development of human capital, to nurture, through our unique ecosystem, a culture of creativity and innovation that enables researchers, scientists, entrepreneurs, and academics to address both local and global research and development challenges,&#x201D; Khalifa Al Kubaisi, Media Relations Manager, QF, explained. <br>\n <br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17qf82","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qf-science-show-transcends-barriers","currSlug":"/media-center/qf-science-show-transcends-barriers","title":"QF Science Show Transcends Barriers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
