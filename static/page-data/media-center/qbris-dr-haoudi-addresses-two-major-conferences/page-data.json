He stated that a key driver for successful collaborations is &#x201C;focusing first on the what, and then figuring out the how,&#x201D; a message that was well received by conference attendees. In addition, many attendees were intrigued to learn about the biomedical research initiatives taking place at QBRI as part of the Qatar National Research Strategy and Qatar National Vision 2030.<br>\n <br>\n QBRI was established to tackle diseases prevalent in Qatar and the Middle East with a focus on developing translational biomedical research and biotechnology. To fulfill its mission, QBRI is setting up cutting-edge research centers in genomic medicine, stem cells and regenerative medicine, gene therapy, and biomedical engineering. The institute also collaborates with national stakeholders and international partners to create a biomedical research network of scientific excellence.<br>\n <br>\n The Biomedical Science and Engineering Center (BSEC) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was established in 2003 as an umbrella organization to provide a platform for biomedical translation of ORNL scientific and technical innovations. <br>\n <br>\n The center started as a joint effort among three ORNL divisions: Computational Sciences and Engineering, Measurement Science and Engineering, and Biosciences. To date, over 40 researchers from all ORNL directorates are affiliated with BSEC, engaging in biomedical, epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and translational research. <br>\n <br>\n The Chemical Institute of Canada (CIC) is the national, not-for-profit, umbrella organization that encompasses the Canadian Society for Chemistry (CSC), the Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering (CSChE) and the Canadian Society for Chemical Technology (CSCT). It is governed and funded by its membership.<br>\n <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Dr_Haoudi_Gives_Keynote_Addresses%20v4.pdf\"><br>\n For the full story, please click here.</a><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf55","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qbris-dr-haoudi-addresses-two-major-conferences","currSlug":"/media-center/qbris-dr-haoudi-addresses-two-major-conferences","title":"QBRI’s Dr Haoudi Addresses Two Major Conferences"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
