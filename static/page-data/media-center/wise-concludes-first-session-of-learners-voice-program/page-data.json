The practical component was complemented by evening sessions delivered by expert faculty from the University of Oxford, Harvard University, University of Bolog&#xF1;a, and Save the Children, among others.<br>\n <br>\n Dina Pasic, Head of Programs, WISE, said: &#x201C;After visiting the Katsikas refugee camp last April, it became clear that if we are to seriously explore social issues, we must immerse ourselves and learn from those directly affected by them. The Learners&#x2019; Voice Program challenges its participants to develop feasible, actionable and educational solutions to such challenges. The setting of a thematic focus was in response to the immediate and ongoing needs of refugees, and the addition of the field component was to enable deeper awareness, to support the work of those on the ground, and to understand the role that the education sector can play in alleviating the symptoms of displacement.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The sessions came to a close following the presentation of five group projects to a panel of education experts, including Mr. Stavros N. Yiannouka, CEO of WISE; and Dr. Stefanos Gialamas, President of the American Community School of Athens; as well as representatives from Project Elea, METAdrasi, and Organization Earth. The residential sessions of the program are designed to support the participants as they research and develop a variety of innovative educational projects throughout the year.<br>\n <br>\n The Learners will continue to develop projects that aim to support the needs of displaced individuals and their host communities through educational interventions. Successful projects will be pitched at the 2017 WISE Summit and the best project will have the opportunity to present at the 2017 Falling Wall Labs Conference in Berlin, Germany. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD-EC-WISE_LVP2017_PressRelease_ENG_20170409.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf40","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-concludes-first-session-of-learners-voice-program","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-concludes-first-session-of-learners-voice-program","title":"WISE Concludes First Session of Learners’ Voice Program"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
