The Primary Years Programme (PYP) Exhibition represents a significant event in the life of every PYP School and student.<br>\n <br>\n The Exhibition is an opportunity for students reaching the end of the PYP curriculum to synthesize the essential elements of the PYP and share them with the whole school community. <br>\n <br>\n In conducting research and communicating it to the entire QAD community, this is also an opportunity for students to exhibit the attributes of the International Baccalaureate (IB) learner profile that they have been developing throughout their engagement with the PYP. <br>\n <br>\n Mrs. Reem Al Mansoori, Assistant Undersecretary for Digital Society Development who visited the Exhibition today, said &#x201C;I was impressed by the technology projects that the grade 5 students exhibited today; they showed how QAD Students are &quot;digital natives&quot; that are born into a technology based world. It is vital that we recognize the central role that technology plays at QAD so that the community is able to address their use for technology appropriately. She added; &#x201C;Recognizing that Qatar&#x2019;s youth are by far the most valuable investment for Qatar&#x2019;s future, the Ministry of Transport and Communications will continue to build partnerships with all community members to fulfill its mandate in support of the youth&#x2019;s technological needs, and to encourage healthy and responsible advances in technology&#x201D;.<br>\n <br>\n Mr. Paul Near &#x2013; Primary School Principal commented &#x201C;Everyone in the school community is excited about the PYP Exhibition.
