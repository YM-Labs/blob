More than 70 percent of the population is either overweight or obese and nearly half of all men&#x2014;48 percent&#x2014;are classified as obese. Furthermore, 83 percent of the population participate in little-or-no physical exercise, with 41 percent not participating in any physical exercise at all. <br>\n <br>\n Almost 16 percent of Qatar Biobank visitors were diagnosed with diabetes, and 86 percent are Vitamin D deficient. Additionally, over 45 percent of participants consume fast food more than three times a week. The Qatar Biobank sample cohort showed a low rate of smokers, with 39 percent of men and 4 percent of women reporting that they smoked. <br>\n <br>\n Other findings show the most prominent types of cancers within the Qatar Biobank population were breast, cervical, and thyroid for women, and prostate and bladder for men.<br>\n <br>\n In presenting, Dr. Afifi said: &#x201C;By generating a comprehensive picture of the environmental, genetic and lifestyle factors that contribute to health issues facing the local population, we can begin to help researchers and healthcare providers make better diagnoses and provide better treatments for diseases affecting the health of Qatar&#x2019;s population.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The demographic data obtained from the registration process shows that a similar number of men (51%) and women (49%) participated, with the highest number of both registering in the 25-34 age group. The mean age of the participants was 39 years, with the youngest registered being 18 years old and the oldest, 85 years.<br>\n <br>\n Qatar Biobank, a member of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF), launched in 2012, will continue to collect biological samples from Qataris and long-term residents to facilitate vital medical research that will enable better healthcare diagnosis and outcomes, and in turn a healthier population. <br>\n <br>\n The two-day Qatar Biobank Conference concludes on Wednesday.
