That&#x2019;s why we created QMEP &#x2013; it gives students the opportunity to see the reality of studying medicine, to take the same sort of classes WCM-Q students take, to inhabit the same environment, and to interact with senior faculty members and current students. That way, students can make an informed choice about whether WCM-Q and a career in medicine is right for them.&#x201D;<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo1%20(7)-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"640\"><br>\n QMEP features a full schedule of lectures on subjects such as biology, human anatomy, chemistry, pharmacology, physiology and adolescent health, among others. The high school students also visited WCM-Q&#x2019;s state-of-the-art Clinical Skills and Simulation Lab, the Distributed eLibrary, and the vivarium, as well as touring the facilities of Hamad Medical Corporation, WCM-Q&#x2019;s affiliate institution where medical students undertake much of their clinical training. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo4%20(2)-24.jpg\" alt=\"Photo4 (2).jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n In addition, students took liberal arts classes on understanding poetry and drama techniques, and received coaching to help them with their college applications, with classes on writing personal statements and interview techniques. Throughout the week, the students worked in groups, to prepare research presentations for a competition, which they delivered on the penultimate day. The program culminated with the announcement of the winners in the final session of the final day. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo3%20(5)-17.jpg\" alt=\"Photo3 (5).jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"640\"><br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180218%20English%20High%20school%20students%20explore%20careers%20in%20medicine%20at%20WCM-Q....pdf\">here</a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf9","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/high-school-students-explore-careers-in-medicine-at-wcm-q","currSlug":"/media-center/high-school-students-explore-careers-in-medicine-at-wcm-q","title":"High School Students Explore Careers in Medicine at WCM-Q"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
