Understanding more about how these ion channels operate sheds light not only on the basic science of animal and plant cells but also on the pathological alterations that cause disease, helping researchers develop effective new medications. <br>\n <br>\n Professor Bovell welcomed the many talented researchers to the meeting and highlighted Qatar&#x2019;s desire to develop a knowledge-based economy for the future. <br>\n <br>\n Eminent scientists who spoke at the event included Professor Brian Harvey of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), who presented findings on the gender-specific nature of cellular functions. Professor Hsiao Chan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) spoke about the role of ion channels in insulin release in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.</div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160307%20English%20Cell%20biology%20experts%20meet%20to%20discuss%20latest%20research.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a><strong>.</strong><br>\n &#xA0;</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2qf83","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/cell-biology-experts-meet-to-discuss-latest-research","currSlug":"/media-center/cell-biology-experts-meet-to-discuss-latest-research","title":"Cell Biology Experts Meet to Discuss Latest Research"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
