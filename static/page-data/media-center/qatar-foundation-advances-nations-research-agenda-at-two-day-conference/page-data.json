Those chosen included the development and deployment of solar energy and production of high value hydrocarbon products, integrated mobility and road safety, integrated health management systems, desalination and water reuse, cyber security and human capacity. <br>\n <br>\n During his closing remarks, Faisal M. Alsuwaidi, President of Research and Development at Qatar Foundation also revealed next steps for overcoming the six major challenges. The coming phase of the strategy will be executed across the nation&#x2019;s institutes, universities, service providers, government, industries and funders and is expected to nurture and enhance innovative research.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I am proud to announce that six grand challenges have been prioritised today. Through our efforts to refine our agenda for the Qatar National Research Strategy, these six will also capture many of the other challenges we are still facing. But by selecting six, we can focus the approach in our strategy implementation and give ourselves the chance to build capacity across a number of sectors nationwide,&#x201D; explained Mr Alsuwaidi. <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf21","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-advances-nations-research-agenda-at-two-day-conference","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-advances-nations-research-agenda-at-two-day-conference","title":"Qatar Foundation Advances Nation’s Research Agenda At Two-Day Conference"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
