It is intended to strengthen leadership capabilities and accelerate improvements in teaching and learning in 18 independent primary schools that form a partnership with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education called the Maharaty. Ninety senior leaders from these schools have been invited to take part in the programme, made possible in part by ExxonMobil Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n The one-day inaugural session at the Marriot Marquis City Center Doha Hotel was led by Dr Asmaa Al-Fadala, Director of Research, WISE. Dr Al-Fadala previously worked with Dr Simon Breakspear, founder and CEO of Australian-based Agile Schools, on a similar programme that supported Qatar Foundation school leaders with strategies and tools to drive sustainable change in teaching practices. The programme has now been extended to these independent primary schools. <br>\n <br>\n The overarching objective of the programme is to support the schools themselves in creating solutions towards further improvement. The workshop series aims to complement this objective by encouraging educators to pursue an evidence-informed focus and learn from research on effective teaching practices to improve their student learning outcomes. <br>\n <br>\n The third and fourth workshops will take place in 2017. The final goal for the participants is to develop strategies to spread high-impact practices to a greater number of teachers and schools.<br>\n <br>\n The programme reflects the continued goal of WISE, part of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF), in supporting government school principals and administrators in Qatar through collaboration, sharing their experiences, and benefiting from specialist advice.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_WISE%20Maharaty%20EN%20PR-2016%2010%2006.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf38","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-collaborates-with-ministry-of-education-and-higher-education-to-support-school-leaders","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-collaborates-with-ministry-of-education-and-higher-education-to-support-school-leaders","title":"WISE Collaborates With Ministry of Education and Higher Education to Support School Leaders"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
