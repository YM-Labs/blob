The installation of many more speed cameras made a very big and positive impact. But we must also accept personal responsibility in the way we drive to further reduce the number of tragedies that occur on Qatar&#x2019;s roads.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr Cheema said it is essential for all road users to obey speed limits, wear seatbelts (both drivers and all passengers) and to help ensure the safety of fellow road users by using indicators, turning headlights on at night, and by avoiding aggressive or reckless behavior such as tailgating, cutting in, driving in the emergency lane and overtaking in inappropriate or risky situations.<br>\n <br>\n She also stressed the importance of not using mobile phones while driving. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/150916%20English%20Slow%20down%20to%20save%20lives.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>. </strong><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf97","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/slow-down-to-save-lives","currSlug":"/media-center/slow-down-to-save-lives","title":"Slow Down to Save Lives"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
