He then ran south to within approximately 30km of the border with Saudi Arabia before heading northeast towards Doha on Salwa Road, eventually arriving at the Corniche four days later to a hero&#x2019;s welcome from friends and family. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Tabrizi, who specializes in research into ovarian and breast cancer and runs the Stem Cell and Microenvironment Laboratory at WCMC-Q, explained his motivation for undertaking the challenge.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The main reason I wanted to run is that there is a real taboo in the Middle East around cancer,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;People who fear they have the disease can be very reluctant to seek treatment because of this taboo and I think that can change if people know more about cancer. <br>\n <img width=\"340\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Tabrizi_Run%20pic%203-9.jpg\" alt=\"Tabrizi_Run pic 3.jpg\"><br>\n &#x201C;There is a widespread belief that if you are diagnosed with cancer then it will definitely be fatal, but this is not correct at all. Because of this fear, patients in the Middle East often present with cancers that are well advanced because they don&#x2019;t go to the doctor when they first realize something is wrong.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I want people to understand that in many cases cancer can be treated &#x2013; for example, breast cancer can very often be cured with an operation and radiotherapy if action is taken at the appropriate time. So my message is that if you think there is something wrong, don&#x2019;t be afraid to go to see your doctor straight away to get it checked.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n He added: &#x201C;I think this is particularly important for women because in the Middle East they play such a key role in society as the center of the household. So the wellbeing of the family is often very dependent on the health of the mother.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://admin.qf.com.qa:443/app/media/13579\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf36","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/incredible-journey-wcmc-q-researchers-360km-desert-run-for-breast-cancer","currSlug":"/media-center/incredible-journey-wcmc-q-researchers-360km-desert-run-for-breast-cancer","title":"Incredible Journey: WCMC-Q Researcher’s 360km Desert Run For Breast Cancer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
