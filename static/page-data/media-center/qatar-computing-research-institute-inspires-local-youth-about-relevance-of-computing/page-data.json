The event featured two inspiring presentations by Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar Alumni Hanan Alshikhabobakr &#x2013; a 2013 Google scholarship recipient and founder of Qatar Robotics Institute for Development; and Ahmad Al-Salama, who works at GE, leading efforts to rollout enterprise resource planning systems across different sites in the Middle East North Africa region.<br>\n <br>\n Highlights of the event included demonstration sessions, where students were given the opportunity to meet and interact with researchers, ask questions, and gather first-hand knowledge of the latest technological innovations made possible by programming.<br>\n <br>\n The demos showcased current research underway at QCRI, including a Braille keyboard &#x2013; an application for smartphones that helps the visually impaired to type quickly and efficiently; a Kinect-based program for exercise for the elderly based on fitness level; a state-of-the-art automated transcription system for Modern Standard Arabic (QCRI Advanced Transcription System &#x2013; QATS); and the MicroMappers platform for rapidly assessing humanitarian disaster damage and the resulting needs, and advanced 3D video applications. Students were also able to see a live demonstration of cube robots and printable robots developed at CSAIL.<br>\n <br>\n QCRI&#x2019;s 2015 summer internship program, now accepting applications, offers local university students the opportunity to develop their innovation and technical skills in a hands-on environment, working on real world problems.More information can be found on the QCRI website <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.qcri.qa/join-us\"><strong>www.qcri.qa/join-us</strong></a>.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/5%204%202015%20QCRI_Coding%20is%20Cool%20Event%20PR%20EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf4","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-computing-research-institute-inspires-local-youth-about-relevance-of-computing","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-computing-research-institute-inspires-local-youth-about-relevance-of-computing","title":"Qatar Computing Research Institute Inspires Local Youth about Relevance of Computing"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
