With many students back for their second year, and others following in their siblings&#x2019; footsteps, SCPP is becoming an annual tradition for some families.<br>\n <img width=\"3861\" height=\"2574\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/02_CMU-Q.jpg\" alt=\"Carnegie Mellon University\"><br>\n SCPP is a summer program designed to better prepare secondary school students for college. Many students go on to attend CMU-Q, and also to recommend SCPP to their younger family members. Nearly 25% of the incoming freshman class has completed SCPP, while about 15% of the class has an older sibling who has attended CMU-Q.<br>\n <br>\n Fatima Al-Khuzaei, who attends Al Arqam Academy, learned about the program through her sister, who is entering her third year at CMU-Q: &#x201C;This is my second year taking part in the SCPP and once again it has been an incredible experience. I&#x2019;m planning to apply to the computer science program next year, and by taking part in SCPP I was able to meet the professors and was introduced to the course material.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Damian Dourado, director of outreach programs at CMU-Q, noted: &#x201C;The Summer College Preview Program is an opportunity for secondary students to explore different college disciplines and experience the rigor of university-level academics. The program is excellent preparation for students applying to top universities, and students who complete the program are so happy they often recommend it to their younger siblings.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Programs are held throughout the year for secondary students interested in studying biological sciences, business administration, computer science and information systems. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/20-08-2016%20CMU-Q%20SCPP%20ENG%20PR%20FINAL.pdf\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf53","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/summer-college-preview-program-a-family-tradition-at-cmu-q","currSlug":"/media-center/summer-college-preview-program-a-family-tradition-at-cmu-q","title":"Summer College Preview Program A Family Tradition At CMU-Q"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
