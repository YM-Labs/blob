The researchers then measured the levels of over 400 different small molecules, called metabolites that are found in the blood of every person. <br>\n <br>\n The relation between metabolite levels and differences between every individual&apos;s genes was recorded and, through statistical analysis, it was found that there are 145 genes that have a significant effect on the body&#x2019;s metabolic capacities. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Suhre said: &#x201C;Many of the 145 genes we identified are enzymes. Enzymes are there to produce the different metabolites &#x2013; the sugars, fats and amino acids that are the building blocks the body needs. They also eliminate toxic substances and excess metabolites from our system. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Genetically, everyone has these enzymes but no-one is identical in what concerns their genetic make-up, so we&#x2019;re looking for differences in what an individual&apos;s enzymes can do by generating a comprehensive picture of over 400 metabolites for every blood sample we measure.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr Suhre said: &#x201C;To treat a disease, such as diabetes or cancer, if you want to change the levels of a certain metabolite, the map would tell you which enzyme to target, but it would also tell you which other metabolites and enzymes surrounding the target would be affected, so that you can select the right combination of drugs in order to reach a desired effect.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read the study in full visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.2982.html\">www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.2982.html</a><br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/140520%20English%20Metabolic%20Map%20of%20Human%20Body%20Created.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10qf13","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/metabolic-map-of-human-body-created","currSlug":"/media-center/metabolic-map-of-human-body-created","title":"Metabolic Map of Human Body Created"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
