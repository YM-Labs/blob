Prof. Riboli will offer key insights into the unique role of cohorts in research focused on the interaction between genetic and epigenetic characteristics in combination with environmental exposures and endogenous and metabolic characteristics. <br>\n <br>\n Professor Khawla Al-Kuraya will deliver a paper entitled &#x2018;Genomic Cancer Research: Identification of Molecular Signature of Common Diseases&#x2019; that will examine how the study of different human populations offers insights into disease pathogenesis, based on genomic analysis of colorectal cancer in Saudi Arabian patients.<br>\n <br>\n During the panel discussion on &#x2018;The Importance of Human Disease Biobank&#x2019;, Professor Peter Riegman of Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Netherlands, will present his paper on &#x2018;Tissue Bank and Digital Pathology&#x2019;. The session will explore the role of tissue banking in accessing the promises of precision or personalized medicine, especially where new targets need to be discovered for new therapies, accompanied by the need for the discovery of new biomarkers. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_Qatar%20Biobank_Conference%20Speakers_PR_EN-2017%2002%2021.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf20","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qbb-congress-discuss-key-biomedical-topics","currSlug":"/media-center/qbb-congress-discuss-key-biomedical-topics","title":"QBB Congress Discuss Key Biomedical Topics"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
