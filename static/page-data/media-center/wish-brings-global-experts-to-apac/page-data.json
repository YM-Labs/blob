At the same time, the cost of treating cancer is rising at an even faster rate, reaching $300 billion worldwide. Meanwhile, more than 50 percent of all new cancers and two-thirds of the annual cancer mortality worldwide happen in low-income and middle-income countries. <br>\n <br>\n Without profound change, cancer care is too expensive for most patients, many payers and nearly all governments. Professor Thomas, who led the WISH research effort on &#x2018;Delivering Affordable Cancer Care&#x2019;, will present actionable recommendations that will help policymakers to &#x2018;bend the cost curve&#x2019; and ensure sustainable access to cancer care. <br>\n <br>\n The APAC Forum 2015 will take place over 23 to 25 September at Auckland&#x2019;s SKYCity Convention Centre in New Zealand. <br>\n Approximately 130 speakers across 42 sessions are scheduled for APAC 2015. Ruby Wax, Professor Charles Vincent; Professor Jonathon Gray, and Itay Talgam are among other high profile speakers confirmed to speak at APAC this year. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/20_09_2015_WISHAPAC_En.pdf\"><strong>click here. </strong></a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28qf7","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-brings-global-experts-to-apac","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-brings-global-experts-to-apac","title":"WISH Brings Global Experts to APAC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
