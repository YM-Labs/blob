Among them are the involvement of family members to protect the FOB&#x2019;s reputation and survival, their long term view on performance and a cautious approach to debt and finance. In addition, he also cited their ability to instill loyalty amongst employees, strict controls on operating and capital expenditures and expanding international operations.<br>\n <br>\n However, he cautioned that FOBs in the GCC are also faced with a growing array of threats which could affect their resilience and preparedness for future generations.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Today&#x2019;s Family Owned Businesses in the GCC need to be alert and address certain issues in order to meet the family&#x2019;s short and long term objectives,&#x201D; Professor Besanger said.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Among them is the fact that a majority of these FOBs have inadequate corporate governance procedures in place. More often than not, these companies also have unclear and risky relationships between the private family office and the corporate structure. It is also not unusual for family members to frequently switch between being owners and managers, which at times poses an unnecessary risk to value creation. Many FOBs are also paying too little attention to cyber-security.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/HEC%20Paris%20FOB%20Eng%20-%20Final.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong>.</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf62","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/addressing-the-needs-of-family-owned-businesses-in-the-region","currSlug":"/media-center/addressing-the-needs-of-family-owned-businesses-in-the-region","title":"Addressing the Needs of Family Owned Businesses in the Region"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
