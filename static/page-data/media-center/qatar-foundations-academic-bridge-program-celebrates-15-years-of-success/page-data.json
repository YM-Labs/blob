Established in 2001, the pre-university program is designed to provide students with a comprehensive, holistic education that prepares them for a future of success. <br>\n <img width=\"1960\" height=\"1396\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/ABP%20Image%202.jpg\" alt=\"null\"><br>\n Through the provision of a rigorous two-semester syllabus, which focuses on developing English language skills, maths, science, and computer skills, combined with a plethora of extra-curricular activities, the ABP aims to build skills for life, serving as a bridge to higher education and a gateway to the future.
