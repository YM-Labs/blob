During his speech, Mr. Schillings urged the public to take an active role in the task of improving the nation&#x2019;s health by completing the first-of-its-kind survey. He pointed out that creating a healthier society in Qatar should not be viewed as solely the responsibility of those working in the healthcare sector, but that individual members of society should also play their part.<br>\n <br>\n Commenting on the importance of community engagement in improving the health of Qatar&#x2019;s population, Mr. Schillings said: &#x201C;What we have seen over and over again is that local employers, schools, community organizations, and individuals are eager and ready to make a positive impact on the population&#x2019;s health.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Encouraging wide-ranging community engagement is a crucial element of Qatar&#x2019;s aim of creating a healthy population in the long-term. The factors that determine a population&#x2019;s health are numerous and intertwined; health is shaped by the conditions in which we are born, grow, live, work, play, and age. We are all co-creators of our health and the public cannot be passive in developing a strong health strategy.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n This year&#x2019;s Middle East Forum on Quality and Safety in Healthcare was attended by nearly 3,000 healthcare professionals from Qatar and the GCC, and offered more than 50 workshops, plenaries, lectures, and a poster competition. <br>\n <br>\n The Qatar Public Health Strategy 2017-2022 survey can be accessed through <a href=\"https://phs.moph.gov.qa\">https://phs.moph.gov.qa</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf31","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/public-participation-urged-in-national-health-strategy","currSlug":"/media-center/public-participation-urged-in-national-health-strategy","title":"Public Participation Urged In National Health Strategy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
