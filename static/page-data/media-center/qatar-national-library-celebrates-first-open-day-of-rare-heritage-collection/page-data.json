This is the first French translation of the Holy Qur&apos;an, undertaken by the famous French orientalist Andr&#xE9; Du Ryer (1580-1660), Consul of France in Egypt and Turkey. <br>\n <br>\n It is this translation that had a strong influence on knowledge of the Holy Qur&apos;an in Western Europe and inspired translations into English, German, Dutch and Russian.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Claudia Lux, Qatar National Library&#x2019;s Project Director said, &#x201C;We are grateful for the support we saw from the community and from foreign dignitaries. We thank Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser and His Excellency Sheikh Hassan Bin Mohammed Al Thani for their vision, generosity and passion in assembling such a significant and relevant historical record for the people of Qatar.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Officials were also joined at the event by Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s Senior Heritage Specialist Mohammed Hammam Fikri who gave guests a personal and in-depth tour of the collection. Earlier in the week, the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to the State of Qatar, Angelika Renate Storz-Chakarji, visited the Heritage Collection building to learn about the collection and items of historical significance to both Germany and the region, including the first Holy Qur&apos;an printed in Germany. <br>\n <br>\n Tours of the exclusive Heritage Collection are offered to the public regularly.
