The ABP has served over 2500 young men and women since its foundation in 2001. Nearly 90 percent of those attending have been Qataris, and over 85 percent of the ABP graduates have later attended English language universities in Qatar or abroad. <br>\n <br>\n The ABP Alumni Gathering was a celebration of the former ABP students&#x2019; successes &amp; achievements over the past 13 years. The ABP alumni were reunited with their former ABP classmates, they met ABP faculty and staff members and enjoyed traditional Qatari hospitality. <br>\n <br>\n The celebrations ran from 5:00 &#x2013; 8:00pm as large numbers of alumni, from around the world, were welcomed back to the ABP and caught up with each other over karak tea and Arabic coffee which was served under a traditional Qatari tent.<br>\n <br>\n Some of the guests were alumni who have completed their university studies and joined the work force to pursue their professional careers, while others were students who are currently studying in universities such as the HBKU partner universities, British universities, American universities, European universities, Canadian universities and universities in Qatar such as Qatar University.<br>\n <br>\n For the past 13 years, the ABP has not only developed the academic curriculum, but has also built on its student activities, through the promotion of leadership, social, recreational and sporting events. In that time, ABP developed a Learning Resource Center (LRC) for tutoring students in Math, Science, Computers and English Language. <br>\n <br>\n ABP also organizes several training courses in IELTS, SAT and ACT, and created &#x201C;The English Room&#x201D; to help students enhance their English language skills.<br>\n <br>\n In 2011, the ABP was awarded five years accreditation by the Commission on English Language Accreditation (CEA) in the United States. This makes it easier to fast-track ABP graduates into universities in the United States without the need for them to complete a university foundation year.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/ABP%20Alumni%20Reunion%202014_EN.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf19","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qfs-academic-bridge-program-hosts-reunion-for-past-students","currSlug":"/media-center/qfs-academic-bridge-program-hosts-reunion-for-past-students","title":"QF’s Academic Bridge Program Hosts Reunion for Past Students"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
