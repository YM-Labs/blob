Mr. Steven van Hoogstraten, interim CEO, and Dr. Stephen J. Rapp, non-resident fellow from The Hague Institute for Global Justice were invited to provide their expertise on international law and dispute resolution, Law of the Sea, aviation law, and international human rights. <br>\n <br>\n Following this event, on October 17, HBKU is inviting Dr. Hassan Hakimian, director of the London Middle East Institute and visiting professor at HBKU&#x2019;s College of Humanities and Social Sciences, to give a lecture titled &#x201C;Do Economic Sanctions Work?&#x201D; at the Qatar National Convention Centre. Dr. Hakimian is a widely published author on the region&#x2019;s economic dynamics, with a special focus on Iran, human capital, availability of resources, and complexities within existing labor markets across the wider Arab world. <br>\n <br>\n The lecture will highlight the historical experiences of this region when it comes to economic sanctions, and will provide analysis to reflect critically on recent developments. Dr. Hakimian will also spend time examining the possible motivations behind the adopted measures by the blockading countries, and will offer his views on the effectiveness of such sanctions in the Qatari context.<br>\n <br>\n On October 23, a panel discussion on the impact and prospects for Qatar after the blockade will be held by HBKU&#x2019;s College of Islamic Studies. The panel has a roster of highly distinguished scholars from leading local and international institutions with wide-ranging specializations, encompassing fields such as international law, sociology, security studies, and more. They will discuss the dynamics of the blockade against Qatar by investigating its political, economic, legal, and social aspects to provide audiences with a comprehensive picture of the current situation and potential policy outcomes for the future.<br>\n <br>\n Those interested in registering to attend any upcoming HBKU events should visit hbku.edu.qa. <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf67","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-hosts-events-to-discuss-the-illegal-blockade","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-hosts-events-to-discuss-the-illegal-blockade","title":"HBKU Hosts Events to Discuss the Illegal Blockade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
