It introduces participants to key leadership strategies needed to drive and support change in teaching practice, in order to achieve and incubate excellence in line with the aspirations of QF. <br>\n <br>\n In preparation for the session, participants were given a short exercise to reflect on their actions, outcomes, and what was learned over the duration of the program, as well as a reading focused on teacher learning. School leaders then discussed and reviewed the challenges they face, and designed evidence-informed solutions and detailed plans to address them. <br>\n <br>\n The program, which was made possible in part by ExxonMobil, focused on encouraging school principals, assistant principals and head teachers in Qatar to reflect WISE&#x2019;s strategy to support some of the country&#x2019;s most influential change-agents. This approach to further progressing reform and innovation in local schools was discussed in detail in the WISE Research report &#x2018;K-12 Reform in the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries&#x2019; (2015), written by Dr Asmaa. <br>\n <br>\n Additionally, throughout the program, participants received ongoing support through in-school coaching related to their change projects in their unique school environments, forming a supportive leadership community. The goal is for these senior leaders to develop the necessary leadership capabilities and experiences to support every teacher in continuously improving their practice.<br>\n &#xA0;<br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/04%2005%2016%20WISElearnlabs%20Event%20PR%20EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf37","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-collaborates-with-edi-to-support-qf-school-leaders","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-collaborates-with-edi-to-support-qf-school-leaders","title":"WISE Collaborates with EDI to Support QF School Leaders"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
