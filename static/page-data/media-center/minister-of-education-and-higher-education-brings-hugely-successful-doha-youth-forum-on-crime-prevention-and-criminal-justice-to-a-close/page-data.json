Their recommendations were put forward in the Doha Youth Forum Declaration, which was presented at the start of the closing ceremony. The Declaration will be presented by young people to the 13th UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, which is taking place in Doha. <br>\n <br>\n His Excellency Dr Mohammed Abdul Wahed Al-Hammadi, the Minister of Education and Higher Education and the Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council (SEC), who delivered the opening keynote address, said: &#x201C;I am pleased to speak to you in this great Forum that brings together a select group of the world&#x2019;s youth who came to Doha with the dedication and will to participate, because these forums provide an opportunity for strengthening ties, communications and cooperation among the world&#x2019;s youth as well as getting to know the cultures, experiences and points of view of their peers regarding the building of their home nations.<br>\n <img width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" alt=\"His Excellency Dr Mohammed Abdul Wahed Al-Hammadi\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/pic%202.JPG.jpeg\"><br>\n &#x201C;The response of the State of Qatar to host the Doha Youth Forum and the UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice proves its leading role in the international family and its unwavering faith in the role of the youth and their contributions to sustainable development.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n His Excellency added: &#x201C;The progress of nations depends on the proper employment of their resources, especially human resources. As we meet with the youth from several countries and listen to their points of view and ideas for the future, we firmly believe that they represent the foundation of development.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;What we are witnessing today, meeting with a select group of ambitious youth in this important Forum, is a great picture of peaceful coexistence, accord and brotherhood of man between the followers of all religions, cultures and civilizations of the world. It is also part of the process of human development, leading us to the progress and sustainable development we are looking to achieve.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Being aware of the need of nations for trained young talent and pledging to support them and ensure their participation in the challenges and issues facing their outcomes is the inevitable result of progress the world is witnessing in its transformation into a knowledge community. Here, we reiterate that the Supreme Education Council is committed to supporting the educational process in every possible way by applying modern educational methods that aid the growth of the youth and provide services and activities, enabling them to become decision makers and nurturing their positive nature in order to prevent them from falling into the world of crime and empower their human values such as compassion, rejection of violence and acceptance of others,&#x201D; he added.<br>\n <br>\n Delivering the event&#x2019;s closing remarks, Engineer Saad Al Muhannadi, President of Qatar Foundation, said: &#x201C;We are happy about the participation in the first Doha Youth Forum on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, which represents a unique initiative by the State of Qatar to provide youth in Qatar and around the world with an opportunity to have their say in building a better future, free of crime.<br>\n <img width=\"1824\" height=\"2736\" alt=\"pic 3.JPG\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/pic%203.JPG.jpeg\"><br>\n &#x201C;Due to the close resemblance between these ideas and QF&#x2019;s message of unlocking human potential, particularly among the youth, the job of organizing this forum fell on our shoulders, in cooperation with the Organising Committee for the 13th United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The President of Qatar Foundation expressed his hope that this Forum &#x201C;realises its goal in raising a generation of educated youth, aware of the problems faced by our world, so they can be well equipped to find the right solutions. The importance of this Forum lays in the fact that young people are the leaders of today and tomorrow, and without their contributions, we cannot hope to develop our societies. Hence, it is crucial to sharpen their skills and enhance their knowledge so they can assume these roles. This purely Qatari initiative enables the participating youth to role play that of their peers at the 13th United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, examining the issues from their own youthful perspective, and presenting their recommendations to the Congress.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Eng. Al Muhannadi concluded: &#x201C;This Forum has strived to select a group of educated and talented youth, from different nationalities and backgrounds, in order to provide a holistic look at the proposed issues, draw conclusions that reflect the diversity, and allow the participants to leave their fingerprints on different UN procedures and regulations. Hence, it hit two birds with one stone, as it trains the youth to assume command in the future, in addition to allowing their ideas to find its way in the present.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/09_04_15_DYF%20Conclusion_Eng_FINAL.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10qf20","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/minister-of-education-and-higher-education-brings-hugely-successful-doha-youth-forum-on-crime-prevention-and-criminal-justice-to-a-close","currSlug":"/media-center/minister-of-education-and-higher-education-brings-hugely-successful-doha-youth-forum-on-crime-prevention-and-criminal-justice-to-a-close","title":"Minister of Education and Higher Education Brings Hugely Successful Doha Youth Forum on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to a Close"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
