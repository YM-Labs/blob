HBKU Press regularly hosts such initiatives as a part of their commitment to help develop the academic and literary landscape of the local and regional community. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;With this workshop, HBKU Press aims to support local researchers by providing them with the knowledge they need to get their work published by a world-class publishing house founded on international best practices, excellence and innovation,&#x201D; explains Dr. Alwaleed Alkhaja, Senior Editor at HBKU Press. &#x201C;Our partnership with Nature is exemplary of our high standards and our commitment to bringing the best resources that the world has to offer to local researchers in Qatar.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The full-day workshop catered towards researchers who are beginning to publish their work in scientific journals. It focused on the writing process and what to include in each section of the paper whereby participants developed strategies to structure and edit manuscripts, improve figure presentation and how to put this into practice. Using examples submitted by the participants, the editors also performed a &#x2018;live edit&#x2019; where they dissected and examined an abstract to the group.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Pep P&#xE0;mies, Chief Editor at Nature Biomedical Engineering, and Dr. Alison Stoddart, Chief Editor at Nature Reviews Materials, both of whom have a combined 20+ years of experience in editorial experience, led the workshop of around 30 participants with an extremely positive reception.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;For us, we gauge whether an event is successful based on the participant&#x2019;s engagement and if they gain any practical and valuable knowledge from the session,&#x201D; explained Dr. Stoddart. &#x201C;At the end of the day, we work with organizations [like HBKU Press] in order to help support solid research output.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/05%2013%2017_HBKU%20Press%20and%20Nature%20Masterclasses%20host%20joint%20workshop_ENG%5B1%5D.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf90","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-press-and-nature-masterclasses-host-joint-workshop","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-press-and-nature-masterclasses-host-joint-workshop","title":"HBKU Press and Nature Masterclasses Host Joint Workshop"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
