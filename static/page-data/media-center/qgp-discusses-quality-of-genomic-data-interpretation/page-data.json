It can store data on hundreds of thousands of samples in one database, and its interface offers researchers an easy way to access and analyze data from multiple subjects simultaneously.<br>\n <br>\n Commenting on the workshop, Dr. Said Ismail, Manager of QGP, said: &#x201C;The workshop provides a hands-on introduction to the research and clinical interpretation interfaces through which researchers will be able to conduct their future analyses on genomic data. We thank all of our participants and partner institutions for hosting this crucial workshop.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Qatar Biobank and the Qatar Genome Programme, both members of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF), have now generated the first 3,000 whole genomes and inputting the phenotypic data on the WuXi NextCODE GOR database for further study and are developing partnerships with local stakeholders to increase the quality of genomic data analysis.<br>\n &#xA0;<br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/02%2001%202017%20QGP_GOR%20Workshop_PR_EN.pdf\">here</a></strong>.</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf76","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qgp-discusses-quality-of-genomic-data-interpretation","currSlug":"/media-center/qgp-discusses-quality-of-genomic-data-interpretation","title":"QGP Discusses Quality of Genomic Data Interpretation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
