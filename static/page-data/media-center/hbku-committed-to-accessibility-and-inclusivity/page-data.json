Sometimes they have concerns about finding resources, but I thank God for the Translation and Interpreting Institute - they accepted me, welcomed me, and have been willing to adjust to meet my needs.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n After pursuing an undergraduate degree in English and mass communications, Abu-Sharida began to work as a script-writer at <em>Al Jazeera Children&#x2019;s Channel</em> in 2013. Eager to continue her studies, she was drawn to the program at TII in order to challenge herself and in the hope of being an inspiration, not only to her siblings, but also others who are blind. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Nicholas Goodbody, one of Kholoud&#x2019;s professors at TII, noted, &#x201C;Kholoud was accepted onto the MA in Translation Studies program because of her academic record and her strong interest in translation. In class, we give her the same opportunities to develop her knowledge as we do to everyone else. We of course make accommodations for her specific needs, but they are in no way a barrier to her getting the most out of the program &#x2013; it simply gives her a unique perspective on translation.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Committed to helping its students unlock their potential, HBKU is currently accepting applications for its fall 2016 intake across a wide range of programs. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/151111_HBKU%20Accessibility_English_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">click here.</a> </strong> <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf41","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-committed-to-accessibility-and-inclusivity","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-committed-to-accessibility-and-inclusivity","title":"HBKU Committed to Accessibility and Inclusivity"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
