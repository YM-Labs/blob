Fox Foundation for Parkinson&#x2019;s Research (MJFF).<br>\n <img width=\"4608\" height=\"3072\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Dr%20Omar%201.jpg\" alt=\"null\"><br>\n There are currently believed to be around 5 million people living with Parkinson&#x2019;s worldwide, with no proven cure. A neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system, the disease affects the body&#x2019;s motor system and causes the death of dopamine-generating cells in a region of the midbrain. Most common in adults over the age of 60, the symptoms include tremor, rigidity, slowness, as well as dementia and depression in more advanced stages.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. El-Agnaf is considered a pioneer in the field of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease and related disorders, with his research discoveries well known for providing incredible insight into the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Shortly after completing his Ph.D. in Biochemistry at Queen&#x2019;s University in Belfast, he was awarded a research fellowship from the Parkinson&#x2019;s Disease Society-UK. Moving to the Gulf region in 2004, Dr. El-Agnaf continued his research into the disease. He joined Hamad bin Khalifa University in 2014. <br>\n <br>\n Founded by actor Michael J. Fox, MJFF has been noted by the New York Times as &#x201C;the most credible voice on Parkinson&#x2019;s research in the world.&#x201D; The foundation is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson&apos;s disease through an aggressively funded research agenda and the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson&apos;s today. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please<strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160123_MJFF%20Grant%20Parkinsons%20Research_English.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> click here.</a></strong><br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf26","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-professor-wins-prestigious-grant-for-parkinsons-research","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-professor-wins-prestigious-grant-for-parkinsons-research","title":"HBKU Professor Wins Prestigious Grant for Parkinson’s Research"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
