It is user-friendly, designed to be rotatable on two sides and allows non-Arabic speakers to learn how to match English letters and sounds, such as their name, to their Arabic phonetic counterparts. <br>\n <br>\n With QFI support, Moneera worked closely with US-based teachers of Arabic in Washington, DC to finalise the wheel&apos;s design. Two Arabic teachers in Tucson, Arizona also assisted in developing the user guide and curriculum. <br>\n <br>\n Originally launched in the US as a physical device, the wheel is being brought to the digital world through the combined efforts of QCRI, QFI and the original designer, in an effort to extend its reach globally to individuals and communities unfamiliar with Arabic. <br>\n <br>\n With QCRI&#x2019;s expertise in technology around Arabic language research and development, and leveraging the technical advancements that have been made thus far, QFI is now launching the Mobile Application version of Madar Al-Huruf. <br>\n <br>\n Users can download the app from the iTunes store and onto their smart mobile device by visiting <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/mx/app/madar-al-huruf/id717596929?l=en&amp;mt=8.\">https://itunes.apple.com/mx/app/madar-al-huruf/id717596929?l=en&amp;mt=8.</a><br>\n <br>\n &quot;Learning the basics of Arabic by writing your name, the name of your hometown or a friend&apos;s name demystifies the language and increases appreciation for the culture in the process. And that is the goal of Madar al-Huruf,&quot; says Maggie Mitchell Salem, Executive Director at Qatar Foundation International. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Stephan Vogel, Principal Scientist in the Arabic Language Technologies team at QCRI, said, &#x201C;We identified a gap in the online education domain for language learning and have been developing supportive technology for language learning including an assistive language learning tutor and an Arabic e-book reader.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/09_%2010_%202013_QCRI_Madar%20Al-Huruf%20press%20release_ENGLISH_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf36","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qfi-and-qcri-launch-mobile-app-to-increase-knowledge-of-arabic","currSlug":"/media-center/qfi-and-qcri-launch-mobile-app-to-increase-knowledge-of-arabic","title":"QFI And QCRI Launch Mobile App To Increase Knowledge Of Arabic"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
