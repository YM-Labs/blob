It does this by targeting VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) &#x2013; a protein that stimulates the growth of brand new blood vessels (termed vasculogenesis), and also the creation of new blood vessels from existing ones (angiogenesis). The VEGF itself is produced by the cancer cells &#x2013; and the VEGF then attracts the endothelial cells which form new blood vessels around the tumor.<br>\n <br>\n But despite initial success where the Avastin works and prevents the growth of new blood vessels&#x2013; so inhibiting the tumor - patients often suffer from a build-up of resistance to the Avastin whereby the blood vessels begin growing again. In turn this allows the tumor to thrive and potentially spread.<br>\n <img width=\"639\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Bella_Tabrizi-1556-17.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Bella Guerrouahen, a postdoctoral associate in genetic medicine at WCMC-Q\"><br>\n Working in the research laboratory of Dr Arash Rafii, Associate Professor of Genetic Medicine in Obstetrics and Gynecology at WCMC-Q and an expert in stem cell science and gynecologic oncology, Dr Guerrouahen explored the reasons behind the phenomenon.<br>\n <br>\n With funding from Qatar National Research Fund under the Junior Scientists Research Experience program, and support from Dr Ahmed Saleh from the pharmacy at Qatar&#x2019;s National Centre for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), she and her research team discovered that it was the endothelial cells &#x2013; cells that line the walls of blood vessels &#x2013; that were essentially building up a resistance to Avastin. <br>\n <br>\n Because the VEGF was being neutralized by Avastin, the cancer cells instead produced more FGF (fibroblast growth factor), another protein involved in the creation of blood vessels. This allowed the production of new blood vessels to re-start and eventually for the tumor to carry on growing.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Guerrouahen said: &#x201C;What my paper showed was that patients would benefit from a combination of therapies &#x2013; when you use an anti-FGF in tandem with Avastin you get better results. This could apply to other cancers as well.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr Guerrouahen&#x2019;s research can be read in full at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25319392\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25319392</a>. <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/150114%20English%20Breakthrough%20for%20cancer%20researchers%20at%20WCMC-Q.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2qf41","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/breakthrough-for-cancer-researchers-at-wcmc-q","currSlug":"/media-center/breakthrough-for-cancer-researchers-at-wcmc-q","title":"Breakthrough for Cancer Researchers at WCMC-Q"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
