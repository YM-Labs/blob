The course, which ran on 22 and 23 February, was attended by 45 school nurses, who supervise a total of 21 students with diabetes.<br>\n <br>\n The course included many sessions relating to &#x2018;type 1&#x2018; diabetes, the insulin system and its types, and how to adjust insulin dose. There were other sessions that raised issues about high and low blood sugar and how to handle such cases at schools. The role of the school nurse, nutrition and sports was also discussed to help students manage their condition.<br>\n <br>\n Another session looked at the psychological aspect of diabetes, run the by HMC psychiatry Department. Nurses were taught how to manage the different stages that students with diabetes go through, and when to communicate with the parents.<br>\n <br>\n The nurses were also trained on how to apply QDA&#x2019;s &#x2018;Students with Diabetes Medical Plan at School&#x2019; policy. Supported by the Paediatric Endocrinology Department at HMC, the course emphasized the importance of students with diabetes having regular blood sugar tests and administering the glucagon injection if necessary.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Abdullah Al Hamaq, QDA Executive Director said, &#x201C;Through this program, we are mobilizing our efforts and urging decision-makers within schools to create a safe environment for student with diabetes; enabling them to succeed in all academic and health aspects. This can be achieved by applying the &#x2018;Students with Diabetes Medical Plan at School&#x2019; and by being fully committed to perform the responsibilities highlighted by QDA. In time, we hope these responsibilities are endorsed by authorized institutions.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n He added, &#x201C;A law enforcing our recommendations would provide all the necessary tools to take care of school students with diabetes, as well as ensure that all parties are aware of the schools&#x2019; responsibilities and duties towards the students.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/24%2002%202014_QDA%20diabetes%20course%20PR_Eng_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf9","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-diabetes-association-introduces-advanced-diabetes-course-for-school-nurses","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-diabetes-association-introduces-advanced-diabetes-course-for-school-nurses","title":"Qatar Diabetes Association Introduces Advanced Diabetes Course For School Nurses"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
