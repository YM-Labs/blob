The Forum will publish an evidence-based report for discussion at the 2015 Summit.<br>\n <br>\n Professor The Lord Darzi of Denham, Executive Chair of WISH and Director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London, said: &#x201C;In most cases, patient safety failures involve avoidable harm. While raising standards is the responsibility of the entire global healthcare community, it is also a major policy issue. That is why WISH has decided to tackle patient safety this year, and I am delighted that Professor Pronovost has agreed to lead our work in this area.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Professor Pronovost is author of <em>Safe Patients, Smart Hospitals: How One Doctor&#x2019;s Checklist Can Help Us Change Health Care from the Inside Out</em>, as well as more than 400 articles and chapters related to patient safety and the measurement and evaluation of safety efforts. He developed a simple but effective checklist protocol that virtually eliminated central line catheter infections in ICUs across the state of Michigan, saving 1,500 lives and $100 million annually. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story on WISH&#x2019;s website, please <a href=\"http://www.wish.org.qa/media-center/news-details?item=110&amp;backArt=71\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28qf80","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/world-innovation-summit-for-health-to-explore-new-patient-safety-measures","currSlug":"/media-center/world-innovation-summit-for-health-to-explore-new-patient-safety-measures","title":"World Innovation Summit for Health to Explore New Patient Safety Measures"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
