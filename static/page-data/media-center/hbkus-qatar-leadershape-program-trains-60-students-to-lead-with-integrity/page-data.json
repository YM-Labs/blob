The event, hosted by Hamad bin Khalifa University (HBKU), a member of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF), and sponsored by Maersk Oil, took place from 4 to 9 January.<br>\n <br>\n Sixty students from HBKU&#x2019;s partner universities, who are empowered to be Qatar&#x2019;s future leaders, participated in this intense six-day program after going through a rigorous selection criteria. The local edition of LeaderShape was divided into daily themes which focused on building leadership skills, helping participants overcome challenges, and taking students out of their comfort zones as they learnt to thrive outside of the traditional classroom model.<br>\n <br>\n LeaderShape 2014 kicked off with the daily theme of &#x2018;Building Community,&#x2019; followed by &#x2018;The Value of One, Power of All,&#x2019; &#x2018;Challenging What Is, Looking To What Could Be,&#x2019; &#x2018;Bringing Vision to Reality,&#x2019; &#x2018;Living and Leading With Integrity&#x2018;, and concluded with &#x2018;Staying in Action.&#x2019; Together, each one of these themes helped to prepare all participants to take their existing leadership skills to the next level while adhering to LeaderShape&#x2019;s motto to &#x2018;lead with integrity.&#x2019;<br>\n <br>\n HBKU&#x2019;s LeaderShape also merges the theory and the practical, such as the Guest Leader Forum on day three. It is crucial for students to hear about real life situations from industry experts so that they are prepared for both the challenges and successes that come when leading with integrity.<br>\n <br>\n Sheikh Jassim Al-Thani, Head of Qatarization at Maersk Oil Qatar, added, &#x201C;The LeaderShape program is a unique experience that makes a significant and practical contribution towards building the leadership capacity in Qatar and delivering leaders of tomorrow. We hope that many of these students will join organizations like Maersk Oil to continue their practical applications as we will work together to fulfil the Qatar National Vision.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n LeaderShape, a highly successful program established in the United States in 1988, is an annual event open to all students of HBKU and its partner universities interested on further developing their leadership and problem solving skills in an exciting and creative environment. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/140121%20HBKU-s%20Qatar%20LeaderShape%20event%20sponsored%20by%20Maersk%20Oil%20-%20English.pdf\">click here</a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf74","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbkus-qatar-leadershape-program-trains-60-students-to-lead-with-integrity","currSlug":"/media-center/hbkus-qatar-leadershape-program-trains-60-students-to-lead-with-integrity","title":"HBKU’s Qatar Leadershape program trains 60 students to ‘lead with integrity’"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
