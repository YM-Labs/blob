The venue for the workshop was NUQ&#x2019;s Black Box Theater. <br>\n <br>\n During the lecture, Professor Woodworth offered ABP students a unique opportunity to learn how to read a play in an analytical and meaningful way. The lecture invited active audience participation in reading excerpts from two famous works, A Doll&#x2019;s House (Ibsen) and Our Town (Wilder). These are plays that the ABP students study in their Academic Literature classes.<br>\n <br>\n <img width=\"329\" height=\"255\" alt=\"NUQ[22].png.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/NUQ%5B22%5D.png-9.jpg\">Professor Woodworth encouraged the students to look closely into characters&#x2019; motivations and desires, the very things that drive their actions. She explained that, in a play, &#x201C;the drama lies in what is not said&#x201D; and told her audience to pay attention to visual details of stage settings, language nuances, and characters&#x2019; movements and actions.<br>\n <br>\n For most of the students, it was their first lecture at a university and their responses to the experience were quite positive.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/PRESS-RELEASE_NUQ_Lecture_09Nov_EN.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf49","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/abp-students-attend-northwestern-university-lecture","currSlug":"/media-center/abp-students-attend-northwestern-university-lecture","title":"ABP Students Attend Northwestern University Lecture"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
