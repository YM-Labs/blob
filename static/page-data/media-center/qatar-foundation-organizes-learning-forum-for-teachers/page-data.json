At Qatar Foundation, we believe this is the key to unlocking the human potential of future generations.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The Teaching and Learning Forum also hosted a keynote speech by Richard Gerver, an award-winning teacher and school principal, whose groundbreaking work in education has been celebrated by the British National Teaching awards and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation. <br>\n <br>\n Addressing the future of education while referencing conversations he has had with Eric Schmidt, the Executive Chairman of Google, and Stephen &#x2018;Steve&#x2019; Wozniak, Co-founder of Apple, Gerver said: &#x201C;What we have to understand about the nature of change, not just in education, is that it is not about systems and structures, but about people. If you don&#x2019;t change the capacity of people, all you ever lead to are short term measures that will live and die in moments and actually transform nothing.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/11-5-14%20QF%20Pre-University%20Education%20Office%20Learning%20%20teaching%20forum%20PR-%20En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf82","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-organizes-learning-forum-for-teachers","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-organizes-learning-forum-for-teachers","title":"Qatar Foundation Organizes Learning Forum for Teachers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
