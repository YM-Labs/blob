The Arabian Gulf Chapter (AGC) was established in 1992 to adopt the innovations of specialists and professionals in the field of information and libraries and to provide a forum in which these professionals can network. Membership to the chapter is extended to the Gulf countries, but participants from all over the world meet at the conference in an effort to open the dialogue internationally, as opposed to simply focusing on regional discourse.<br>\n <br>\n This year, the 23rd annual conference and exhibition of the SLA/AGC will focus on &#x201C;Quality of Library and Information Training and Educational Programs: The Way Map Towards Accreditation&#x201D;. <br>\n <br>\n As an academic publisher, HBKU Press has a longstanding relationship with the SLA/AGC and is committed to supporting their efforts through sponsorship and through the dissemination of the conference&#x2019;s proceedings on their online, open access platform, QScience.com.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Not only are we sponsoring the conference this year for the fourth year in a row,&#x201D; explains Dr. Alwaleed Alkhaja, Senior Editor at HBKU Press. &#x201C;HBKU Press will be publishing this year&#x2019;s conference proceedings online in a special issue of QScience Proceedings and we will also be publishing a select few, high &#x2013; level accepted research articles in full in a special issue of QScience Connect: HBKU Press&#x2019;s open access journals. <br>\n <br>\n By making these conference proceedings and the accepted research articles available online, HBKU Press allows for the dissemination of information as there is an expectation that conference proceedings have a high rate of downloads. This ultimately means that the information will be made widely available to researchers and academics around the world.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/03%2006%202017_HBKU%20Press%20to%20sponsor%20SLAAGC_ENG.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf19","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-press-sponsors-special-libraries-association","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-press-sponsors-special-libraries-association","title":"HBKU Press Sponsors Special Libraries Association"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
