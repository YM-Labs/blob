In the past, the Hakawati would often travel from town to village, recounting the oral histories handed down from generation to generation. <br>\n <br>\n The two-hour literary majlis featured the preeminent Qatari poets Ali Mirza and Hissa Abdulla in an event moderated by Qatar TV&#x2019;s Tyseer Abdullah. Speaking after the event, Ali Mirza underlined the importance of the literary majlis in order to keep poetry alive and see interest rising amongst future generations.<br>\n <br>\n The latest majlis followed a similar event in March that focused on fiction writers Mai Al-Nakib and Abdulaziz Al-Mahmoud. Both events highlight Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s on-going commitment to promote the very best of local and regional literary talent, in addition to hosting events that both educate and enrich the local community. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Poetry%20Majlis%20Press%20release%20Eng.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf28","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/21st-century-poets-delight-doha-audience","currSlug":"/media-center/21st-century-poets-delight-doha-audience","title":"21st Century Poets Delight Doha Audience"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
