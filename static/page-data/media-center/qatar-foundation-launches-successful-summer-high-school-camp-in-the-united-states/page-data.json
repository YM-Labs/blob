It was part of QF R&amp;D&#x2019;s Office of Education Training and Development (OETD) new educational initiative to promote science-led careers. <br>\n <br>\n The students spent the first week of training in Doha, where they gained strong exposure to the American academic research experience. <br>\n <br>\n The students then spent the following two weeks at UCI where they were able to hone their specific interests in science and engineering. The immersion period included daily seminars focused on topics ranging from fuel cell research, global climate change, DNA extraction and ocean engineering. <br>\n <br>\n Practical tasks saw students perform DNA extractions, and develop ocean and plotting data to monitor the change in carbon dioxide in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere over a specified period of time. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/09-24-2014-%20QF%20R&amp;D%20USA%20SUMMER%20CAMP%20_Eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf73","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-launches-successful-summer-high-school-camp-in-the-united-states","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-launches-successful-summer-high-school-camp-in-the-united-states","title":"Qatar Foundation Launches Successful Summer High School Camp in the United States"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
