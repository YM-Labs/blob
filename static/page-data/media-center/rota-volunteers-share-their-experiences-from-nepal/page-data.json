Volunteers shared their individual experiences and lessons learned describing how the trip increased their interest in offering and giving, and helped them better understand the challenges that students face in rural communities in Nepal. <br>\n <br>\n With the generous financial assistance from Vodafone Qatar and in partnership with in-country partner, Action Aid International, ROTA also provided a computer lab for the school in which students and teachers were taught by volunteers&#x2019; ways to utilize ICT for Education.<br>\n <br>\n During the Trip, volunteers facilitated five hours of classes at the &#x2018;Moti&#x2019; Secondary School in Tikapur for five days for students in subjects such as Social Studies, English Language, Cultural Exchange, Environmental Awareness and Sport. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/PRL_ROTA%20volunteers%20share%20their%20experience%20in%20Nepal%20(ENGLISH).pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20qf79","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/rota-volunteers-share-their-experiences-from-nepal","currSlug":"/media-center/rota-volunteers-share-their-experiences-from-nepal","title":"ROTA Volunteers Share Their Experiences From Nepal"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
