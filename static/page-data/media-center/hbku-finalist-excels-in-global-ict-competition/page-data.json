Huawei Technologies was a great partner to work with because they are a global leader in the communications field. We want our students to play a key role in shaping the future of technology-related industries, creating a positive impact on both Qatar and the world.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n In laboratories situated inside Huawei Technologies&#x2019; headquarters in Shenzen, the Qatar team worked on a simulated scenario involving both theoretical and practical exam components. The complex eight-hour test necessitated competitors to demonstrate working knowledge of firewalls, cloud computing, switching, routing, and network security. They were awarded the Excellence Prize for their efforts in the final ceremony, which was attended by high-ranking government officials and senior representatives from participating countries&#x2019; embassies and consulates.<br>\n <br>\n Describing his takeaway from the three-month journey in the international program, Dabeeruddin said: &#x201C;My most memorable moment was the successful completion of the exam &#x2013; it showed me that my professors and the quality of education at HBKU had effectively equipped me with all the necessary skills and technical knowledge I need to take on an expert-level and international competition. I was particularly honored that, while in China, I could represent the State of Qatar and give back to my community.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read more, click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180109-20--20HBKU-20Finalist-20Returns-20from-20China-20--20EN.pdf\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf49","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-finalist-excels-in-global-ict-competition","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-finalist-excels-in-global-ict-competition","title":"HBKU Finalist Excels in Global ICT Competition"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
