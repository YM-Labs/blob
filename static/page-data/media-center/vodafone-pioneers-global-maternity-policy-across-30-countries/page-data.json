While a number of Vodafone subsidiaries already offer substantial maternity care terms which will continue as before, the new mandatory minimum global maternity policy will make a significant difference to the lives of thousands of Vodafone women employees in countries where there is little or no legislative requirement to provide maternity support.<br>\n <br>\n For Vodafone Qatar, this means its female employees starting maternity leave from now on or those already on maternity leave will benefit from one extra month (total of 112 calendar days) of paid maternity leave. Vodafone provides one of the highest maternity benefits in Qatar where the standard in the market is 50 calendar days off. <br>\n <img width=\"607\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Vodafone%20female%20staff%20and%20their%20children-17.jpg\" alt=\"Vodafone female staff and their children\"><br>\n The news, timed with International Women&#x2019;s Day 2015, was celebrated by Vodafone Qatar&#x2019;s female employees and their children who were invited to spend a few hours with their mothers at the company&#x2019;s headquarters. <br>\n <br>\n The announcement was made by Dalya Al Khalaf Vodafone Qatar&#x2019;s Director of Strategy and Anita Tomany Head of Talent, Capability and Resourcing, as part of a whole week dedicated to Women from 8-15 March 2015 that will include competitions plus learning and networking activities. <br>\n <br>\n Vodafone also announced today the outcome of analysis commissioned from KPMG which indicates that global businesses could save up to an estimated $19 billion annually through the provision of 16 weeks of fully paid maternity leave. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Vodafone%20Maternity%20EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf36","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/vodafone-pioneers-global-maternity-policy-across-30-countries","currSlug":"/media-center/vodafone-pioneers-global-maternity-policy-across-30-countries","title":"Vodafone Pioneers Global Maternity Policy Across 30 Countries"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
