Businesses in the construction, hospitality, oil and petroleum industries took part alongside local schools and educational organizations. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;As part of the Qatar National Vision 2030 to strike a balance between developmental needs and the protection of the nation&#x2019;s environment, we must continue to raise public awareness of the important role that individuals and businesses play in preserving the country&#x2019;s habitats for future generations,&#x201D; explained Meshal Al Shamari, Director of QGBC. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Our Solid Waste Interest Group is at the forefront of this initiative, and together we will be examining the results of this event in a larger report on waste produced in Qatar later this month.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n QGBC founded the Solid Waste Interest Group (SWiG) in 2010 to raise awareness about solid waste issues in Qatar&#x2019;s built environment. <br>\n <br>\n Visit the No Paper Day Qatar Facebook page for more information: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/No-Paper-Day-Qatar/175504132599075\">http://www.facebook.com/pages/No-Paper-Day-Qatar/175504132599075</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10qf89","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/no-paper-day-qatar","currSlug":"/media-center/no-paper-day-qatar","title":"No Paper Day Qatar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
