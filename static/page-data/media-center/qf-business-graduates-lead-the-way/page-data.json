The CFA challenge is a global competition that takes place annually and offers students the opportunity to learn from leading industry experts and compete with peers from the world&#x2019;s top finance programs. <br>\n <br>\n As part of the competition, held in Dublin last month, the team conducted an in-depth analysis of Ooredoo stock to produce comprehensive research and a recommendation, and then presented to an independent panel of judges from the financial sector in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n The CMU-Q team was the first ever from the Middle East region to reach the finals in the history of the competition, and eventually finished in the top eight.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Over the past four years, CMU-Q has taught me how to deliver great presentations and handle Q&amp;A sessions. As a team, we were able to use these skills during the CFA competition, where we presented our research to more than 100 people in Qatar and 300 people in Ireland. This was a great experience for us and a great confidence boost,&#x201D; said Nayyer.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%202%20(4)-24.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2 (4).jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n CMU-Q&#x2019;s Business Administration program trains students in a number of business-related fields, including accounting, management information systems, business communications, finance, and economics. Students also complete a minor in a different discipline to broaden their body of knowledge and to acquire general problem-solving skills.<br>\n <br>\n Lo is passionate about pursuing a master&#x2019;s degree in finance after graduation, and aims to help future QF students to get the same type of education he received in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Qatar Foundation has given me an experience not many people get. It has provided me, and students like me, with a lot of financial support. As alumni, we must help sustain this kind of effort so QF can continue its great work,&#x201D; said Lo.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_QF_BusinessGraduates_Feature_EN_20180501_Clean.pdf\">here</a>.<br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17qf24","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qf-business-graduates-lead-the-way","currSlug":"/media-center/qf-business-graduates-lead-the-way","title":"QF Business Graduates Lead the Way"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
