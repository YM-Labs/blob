The event was organized to mark the conclusion of the Program&#x2019;s second residential session which was held at Ciudad Banco Santander from 2 June to 13 June in Madrid. <br>\n <br>\n For the past two weeks the Learners&#x2019; have been engaged in the Program&#x2019;s second residential session administered by expert facilitators, in partnership with Banco Santander. The sessions&#x2019; content ranged from dynamic exercises on leadership and communication skills, in addition to workshops on disruptive thinking and project development. <br>\n <br>\n The aim of the WISE Learners&#x2019; Voice Program is to bring the views of students to the issue of rethinking education and prepare them to take on leading roles in their fields and in the world of education. The Program is based on the conviction that when students are co-creators of their learning environments they become active participants, invested collectively as stakeholders in their learning environment. <br>\n <br>\n The Program focuses on building their knowledge of education as well as their entrepreneurship, leadership and communication skills. <br>\n <br>\n The current group is developing projects as diverse as an arts and culture hub for the inclusion of children born of war in Uganda, to a curriculum built around the use of 3D printers as tools to engage high-school students in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) subjects. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/140615_Eng%20Press%20Release_LV_Dinner_Madrid.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf55","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-learners-voice-participants-hosted-by-the-ambassador-of-qatar-in-madrid","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-learners-voice-participants-hosted-by-the-ambassador-of-qatar-in-madrid","title":"WISE Learners’ Voice Participants Hosted by the Ambassador of Qatar in Madrid"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
