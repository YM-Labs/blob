It is a chance to be able to teach the community about this particular style.&#x201D; <br>\n <img width=\"2352\" height=\"1569\" alt=\"null\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Grafitti%20Wall%20Image%203.jpg\"><br>\n It took the artists one month, from 5th November to 5th December, to complete the mural. The artists were given the freedom to create a piece of art that combined each of their different styles. Some of the highlights include a woman wearing a batoola holding an incense burner and a dhow, Arabic calligraphy, and a prize-winning horse from Al Shaqab.<br>\n <br>\n Over the course of the month, the public were invited to witness the piece of art come to life as it progressed towards completion. <br>\n <br>\n A permanent fixture at QF, it now stands as a representation of the Foundation&#x2019;s mission and vision to foster a creative and progressive society, as well as a cultural landmark.&#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf24","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-unveils-graffiti-art-wall","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-unveils-graffiti-art-wall","title":"Qatar Foundation Unveils Graffiti Art Wall"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
