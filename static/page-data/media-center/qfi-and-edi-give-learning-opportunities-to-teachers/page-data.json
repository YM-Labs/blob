The online courses concluded on April 23 following a two-day in-person workshop hosted by QFI in Doha.<br>\n <br>\n The TAFL module consists of seven units dedicated to topics that help teachers enhance their knowledge and understanding of key strategies to implement in teaching learners of Arabic as a second or foreign language. The courses consist of interactive presentations, prompts for reflection, readings, links to external resources on the arabicalmasdar.com site, and an online discussion forum supervised by Dr. Mahmoud Al-Batal, an expert in the field of Arabic language education. Through the TAFL module, Qatar Foundation (QF) high school teachers of Arabic 2 learned critical topics such as integration of assessment and lesson planning, providing learners with comprehensible input, learner-centered instruction strategies, and approaches for meeting diverse learners&#x2019; needs, integration of culture, and more.<br>\n <br>\n The in-person workshop served as a follow-up to the online module, providing the teachers with the opportunity for hands-on experience and guidance to implement what they learned online. The focus of the two-day workshop was applied aspects of pedagogical strategies addressed in the module topics.
