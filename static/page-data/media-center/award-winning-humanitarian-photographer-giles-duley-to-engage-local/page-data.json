Duley, who lost both legs and one arm while reporting on conflict in Afghanistan in 2011, will also detail the importance to him of not letting his own disability overshadow his work, or the people on whom he focuses his lens.</p>\n<p>At his workshop on October 10, Duley aims to engage those interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the intricacies of reportage photography and photo-journalism. In particular, he will explore ways to get impactful images that respect those being photographed.</p>\n<p>Duley said: “For me the core of my work is the story. The technical aspects of photography are always secondary when it comes to producing a photograph, most important is building a relationship with the subject of the image. At the end of the day, it is their story and my work must be honest to them.</p>\n<p>“This will be the first time I’ve done a talk and workshop in Doha and I’m thrilled at the opportunity to share the stories of those I’ve photographed and my own experiences over 25 years working as a photographer. Photography is my life and it’s always a joy to talk with those who share my passion.\"</p>\n<p>Mahmoud El Achi, Research and Policy Development Officer, WISH, and photographer, said: “The community of photography enthusiasts in Qatar has been growing recently, so we are pleased to host a world-renowned photographer who can inspire the local community to use their passion for a good cause.”</p>\n<p>The talk, workshop, and exhibition are open to the public and are free of charge, with the exhibition running until October 25.
