The second module, to complete the Major, will take place in Paris in October 2014.<br>\n <br>\n The increasingly international pull of HEC Paris&#x2019; activities in Qatar is evidenced by the diversity of the 34 participants taking part in the Energy Major with no less than 16 countries represented including: Qatar, France, Russia, Tunisia, India, Congo, Spain, Morocco, Lebanon and the Ivory Coast.<br>\n <br>\n The Energy Major is one of eight majors that HEC Paris Executive MBA participants can select. The other seven are: Luxury, Services, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Aerospace &amp; Aviation, Global Business Perspectives, Digital &amp; Telecom Businesses, and Reinventing Business for Emerging Markets.
