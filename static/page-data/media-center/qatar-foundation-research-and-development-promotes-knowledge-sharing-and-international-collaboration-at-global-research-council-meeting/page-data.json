Research is defining our future. It is a tool that crafts tomorrow&#x2019;s progress. In Qatar, research is essential to achieving the nation&#x2019;s mission and transformation into a knowledge&#x2010;based economy.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;With so many distinguished representatives from the local and international research community, we have the opportunity to build worthwhile and beneficial collaborations.&#x201D; he added. <br>\n <br>\n The event focused on two main themes - &#x2018;Funding the Future&#x2019; and &#x2018;Open Access&#x2019;. Eminent researchers from across the MENA region shed light on their respective country&#x2019;s efforts to address these themes.
