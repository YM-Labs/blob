The purpose of translations is to help contribute to the cultural exchange of information and help to build cross-cultural communication and coexistence that enhance the transfer of thought and knowledge between Arabic and other languages.<br>\n <br>\n Translated volumes allow readers to cross cultural thresholds and find the common humanity in all our stories, while simultaneously discovering different cultures. With that goal, HBKU Press focuses on featuring translated works alongside showcasing Arab talent in order to enrich the Arabic literary scene and enhance cross-cultural communication.<br>\n <br>\n The most recently released translations by HBKU Press include the translation of one Spanish work titled, Games of the Late Age, and two translations from English, Poor Economics and Science and Islam. <br>\n <br>\n Games of the Late Age, written by Spanish author Luis Landero and translated by Saleh Almani, follows an ordinary middle-aged clerk, Gregorio, whose youthful aspirations for an exciting and intellectual life have faded to nothing. Through his conversations with Gil, a modest, mature man exiled in the countryside, Gregorio, forges another personality for himself as Faroni, an attractive polyglot, engineer and poet, and great traveler. Gregorio is so thoroughly immersed in his own lies, however, that when Gil suddenly announces that he is finally coming to meet him, he panics completely. <br>\n In the Non-Fiction genre, Poor Economics, translated by Anwar Al-Shamy, highlights 15 years of research by authors Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo that takes a look at the behaviour of poor people around the world, their needs, and the way that aid or financial investment can affect their lives. <br>\n <br>\n Science and Islam, also a work of Non-Fiction, written by Ehsan Masood and translated by Ayham Al-Sabbagh, tells the story of one of history&#x2019;s most misunderstood yet rich and fertile periods in science: the Islamic scientific revolution between 700 and 1400 CE. The stories, written in a compelling narrative, take the reader on a journey through the Islamic empires of the Middle Ages, and their contributions to science in Western Europe. <br>\n <br>\n The titles present a diverse variety of stories and information that cross cultural, socio-economic, and political borders.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/07%2016%202017_Hamad%20Bin%20Khalifa%20University%20Press-s%20collection%20of%20translated%20works%20helps%20bridge%20cultural%20differences_ENG.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf22","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-press-translated-works-helps-bridge-cultural-differences","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-press-translated-works-helps-bridge-cultural-differences","title":"HBKU Press Translated Works Helps Bridge Cultural Differences"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
