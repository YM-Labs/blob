The competitions are open to innovators from Education City and across Qatar, and enable users to develop and port their applications to visualization and 3D printing systems. Projects are judged on several criteria, including creativity and innovation, functionality and usefulness, feasibility, and student involvement.<br>\n <br>\n Now in its ninth year, the Visualization Development Competition invites researchers to submit proposals to develop research projects using Texas A&amp;M at Qatar&#x2019;s powerful 3D Immersive Visualization Facility, which utilizes scientific visualization to create three-dimensional images and graphics that aid in analyzing complex numerical representation. This technology helps scientists see data sets in new ways so that they can find patterns or relationships and communicate their data to others. Viewers feel completely immersed in the experience, and all images are displayed in 3D with the use of special goggles.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/3D%20Challenge%20Awards_210517__ALX2300%5B1%5D-17.jpg\" alt=\"3D Challenge Awards_210517__ALX2300[1].jpg\" width=\"639\" height=\"426\"><br>\n First place went to Dr. Jeff Cheng-Lung Lee and his collaborators of Qatar Police College for their project &#x201C;Virtual Reality and 3D animation for crime scenes Investigation&#x201D;. Second place went to Dr. Bilal Mansoor and his team from Texas A&amp;M at Qatar for their project &#x201C;Interactive 3D Virtual Reality Based Class Rooms: Making STEM Education Real.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n 3D printing technologies are playing a key role in creating new business and new business opportunities. It was with this understanding that Texas A&amp;M at Qatar established its unique 3-D printing facility &#x2014; the first of its kind in Qatar &#x2014; to allow students, designers, researchers and engineers to step beyond the virtual barriers and interact with real-world objects, and the 3-D Printing competition supports this goal. <br>\n <br>\n First place in the 2017 3D Printing Competition went to the project &#x201C;Custom Design Snorkel Fitting&#x201D; by Kathleen Bates from Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar. Finishing second was the project &#x201C;Video Laryngoscopy for Endotracheal Intubation&#x201D; by Dr. Nabil Shallik from Hamad Medical Corporation. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Texas%20AM%20at%20Qatars%20annual%203D%20Challenge%20encourages%20use%20cutting-edge%20technologies%20to%20solve%20real-world%20challenges%20-%20English%5B1%5D.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf68","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/tamuq-3d-challenge-encourages-local-inventors","currSlug":"/media-center/tamuq-3d-challenge-encourages-local-inventors","title":"TAMUQ ‘3D Challenge’ Encourages Local Inventors"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
