Analysts argue that the rise of digital and mobile communications have accelerated the growth of these immense databases.During her presentation at NU-Q&#x2019;s symposium &#x201C;Big Data, Smart Media? Connecting Content, Audience and Information,&#x201D; Stone also announced that World Newsmedia Network would be holding their next big data conference at the Microsoft headquarters in 2014.<br>\n <br>\n Panelists included Mohammed Haddad, an interactive journalist at <em>Al Jazeera</em> <em>Network</em> who is responsible for creating visualizations in the newsroom. Haddad reminded the young journalists that data is an abstraction of the real world and that its presence on a screen should not deter them from &#x201C;going out and getting [your] own data.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;You must ask yourself how much detail your audience is actually looking for,&#x201D; said Haddad. &#x201C;The story is in the outlier, but the story might also be that there is no data.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Northwestern&#x2019;s website, please <a href=\"http://qatar-news.northwestern.edu/big-data-symposium/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf32","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/equivalent-of-over-100-million-years-of-video-expected-by-2015","currSlug":"/media-center/equivalent-of-over-100-million-years-of-video-expected-by-2015","title":"Equivalent Of Over 100 Million Years Of Video Expected By 2015"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
