Applicants in the early stages of their professional research careers will work closely with one active and senior mentor in the areas of the proposed research to become independent researchers and build new, and enhance existing research in Qatar with a focus on Energy and Environment, Biomedical and Health Sciences, Computer Science and ICT, and Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities.</p>\n<p>Since its inception, QNRF has advanced knowledge and education by providing funding opportunities for original, competitively-selected research and development at all levels and across all disciplines. The ECRA signifies QNRF’s support for research available through and beyond all levels of education, with a range of programs offered for everyone including school students, PhD researchers, and early career professionals.
