New projects are replacing invaluable traditional environments at a rapid pace. This process can be effectively slowed down only through increasing awareness and facilitating public participation in urban and architectural decision making.&#x201D;<br>\n <img width=\"640\" height=\"356\" alt=\"QGBC_Cobranded Logo_BILINGUAL_80-20_PANTONE.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QGBC_Cobranded%20Logo_BILINGUAL_80-20_PANTONE-17.jpg\"><br>\n He added: &#x201C;Architecture is the mirror of society.
