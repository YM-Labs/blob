Dr. Stafrace explained that the cultural context of the region must be appreciated in order to deliver a service patients will trust and feel comfortable with. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Stafrace, who also holds the faculty position of Assistant Professor in Clinical Radiology at WCM-Q, said: &#x201C;As healthcare professionals, we all want to provide patient satisfaction but it can be challenging because so many different factors come into play. In the GCC region, with its very diverse cultural and ethnic populations, economic prosperity, mixed healthcare systems, recent rapid growth and speed of change, patient expectations can be difficult to judge. As such, this is a very important area of study.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Stafrace, who has a strong professional interest in medical administration and patient satisfaction, conducted research into the subject by interviewing senior healthcare executives with years of experience in Qatar and across the GCC.He learned that cultural factors are extremely influential in determining both patient expectations and satisfaction, and that these cultural factors may play a larger role in the GCC compared to other parts of the world. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Thurayya Arayssi, Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Continuing Medical Education at WCM-Q, said: &#x201C;We are delighted to have heard from Dr. Stafrace who has many very important insights into patient satisfaction with specific reference to our region. In order to develop world-class healthcare institutions it is essential to understand the cultural values and needs of the population you serve.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170924%20English%20Cultural%20sensitivity%20crucial%20to%20patient%20satisfaction,%20WCM....pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf12","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-lecture-highlights-cultural-sensitivity","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-lecture-highlights-cultural-sensitivity","title":"WCM-Q Lecture Highlights Cultural Sensitivity"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
