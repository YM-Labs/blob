Its participation will range from having a staffed booth at some of the fairs, to having HBKU Press books made available through distributors, made possible by established distribution agreements between the publishing house and other local publishing companies at the hosting country&#x2019;s fair.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We are growing and, as such, we are setting our sights on international markets,&#x201D; said Bachar Chebaro, Executive Director, HBKU Press. &#x201C;Our presence at these international fairs validates HBKU Press as one of the key players from the Arab region in the global publishing market.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n HBKU Press launches new titles at book fairs, and also hosts book readings and book signing sessions with authors as well as information sessions about the subject matters of our books. <br>\n <br>\n Another avenue it has been pursuing to establish international recognition is participation in &#x2018;rights-sale&#x2019; book fairs, where HBKU Press sells the rights for their books to be translated into other languages, and also buys titles to translate into Arabic.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Selling translation rights of our books into other languages is especially important, as it allows the dissemination of knowledge from Qatar and the region to a global audience,&#x201D; said Mr. Chebaro. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;In addition, buying books from other countries in other languages allows the local community access to new literature, ideas, and knowledge. We are effectively both participating in, and benefiting from, the knowledge economy.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n HBKU Press provides a unique local and international platform for literature, literacy, scholarship, discovery and learning. It publishes fiction and non-fiction titles for adults and children, as well as academic and reference materials, and aims to promote a love of reading and writing by helping to establish a vibrant scholarly and literary culture in Qatar and the Middle East.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/HBKU%20Press%20Set%20to%20Participate%20in%20Over%20Eight%20Book%20Fairs%20During%20the%202018%202019%20Season%20-2528ENG-2529.pdf\">here</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf95","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-press-extends-international-presence","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-press-extends-international-presence","title":"HBKU Press Extends International Presence"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
