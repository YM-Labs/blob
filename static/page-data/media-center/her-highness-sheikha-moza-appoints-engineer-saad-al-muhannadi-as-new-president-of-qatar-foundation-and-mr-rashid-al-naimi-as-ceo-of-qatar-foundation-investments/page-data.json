As one of the founding members of Qatar Foundation, he is steeped in the esteemed traditions of our organization. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;It is now 18 years since Qatar Foundation was founded. From humble beginnings it has grown to become the world-class institution that we see today, spearheading the nation&#x2019;s efforts on our journey towards a knowledge economy. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Engineer Al Muhannadi has been with us throughout this incredible journey, leading the ongoing development of the organization&#x2019;s infrastructure, and I have the utmost confidence in his ability to provide the necessary leadership as Qatar Foundation continues its exciting mission to unlock human potential.

Their strategic expertise will be vital as we continue our plans for expansion.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;And, just as Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s success has come about through collective hard work, so the opportunities afforded by the organization should be available for the collective benefit of the local population. Qatar Foundation was built by Qatar, it is sustained by Qatar, and it belongs to the people of Qatar, regardless of their background and occupation. Qatar Foundation has an extremely bright future, and I am delighted to be a part of it.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Mr Rashid Al-Naimi has demonstrated a flair for strategic implementation and innovation throughout his time at Qatar Foundation, while helping to foster a culture of quality and excellence throughout the organization.

As the organization continues to refine its strategic objectives I am very much looking forward to the challenge of serving as CEO of Qatar Foundation investments.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Outgoing President Dr Fathy Saoud has overseen considerable development at Qatar Foundation as it has become a globally respected institution.
