Initiated by ictQATAR, the project aims to educate low-income workers in Qatar by teaching them essential Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills. <br>\n <img width=\"3680\" height=\"2175\" alt=\"null\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/image%204.jpg\"><br>\n Since ROTA joined the Better Connections program at the beginning of April 2015, 65 volunteers from the local community have been trained by ROTA to educate workers in various locations in Qatar. The volunteers have visited worker accommodations across Doha and helped to train more than 300 Digital Champions in basic computer and internet communication skills.<br>\n <br>\n These Digital Champions, who will be training the low skilled migrant workers on computer skills, have been educated and empowered to go into their community and transfer their skills to other workers in need. Through this innovative cascade model of training, the program is expected to reach over 4,000 low-skilled workers in various companies in Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n At a special event to honor the volunteers and Digital Champions held on 30th December 2015, Arwa Musaaed, ROTA Program Manager, said: &quot;I want to congratulate every volunteer and Digital Champion, and commend them for their vision and commitment in making the Better Connections program a reality. By training Digital Champions, we are not only providing key skills, but we are empowering them to share their knowledge and help shape their communities for the future. Hand-in-hand with our partners and volunteers, we will continue to support low-income workers in Qatar, helping them develop key skills and stay connected to the community.&quot;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/30_12_15%20ROTA_Better%20Connections_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20qf36","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/rota-and-msheireb-properties-honor-volunteers-and-digital-champions-from-landmark-migrant-workers-program","currSlug":"/media-center/rota-and-msheireb-properties-honor-volunteers-and-digital-champions-from-landmark-migrant-workers-program","title":"ROTAand Msheireb Properties Honor Volunteers and Digital Champions from Landmark Migrant Workers Program"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
