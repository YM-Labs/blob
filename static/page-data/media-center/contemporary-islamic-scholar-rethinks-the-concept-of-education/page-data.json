It also entails assuming our individual responsibilities by first abandoning the victim attitude, in order for us to then make courageous decisions,&#x201D; said Dr Ramadan. <br>\n <br>\n Acquiring &#x2018;purposeful knowledge&#x2019; requires the study of revealed texts along with that of reality and the status quo, he added, as the careful reflection of such literature will foster a better understanding of contextual reality. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Ramadan said, &#x201C;It [purposeful knowledge] necessitates avoiding cognitive isolation, in addition to linking schools to their surrounding environment, by adopting the principle of social solidarity. This kind of purposeful knowledge cannot be fulfilled without first acquiring aesthetic and artistic characteristics through the promotion of creativity.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n He added that humility plays a pivotal role in the acquisition of &#x2018;purposeful knowledge&#x2019;. The seminar went on to spark an audience debate about the various pedagogical problems, resulting from a lack of institutional ethics.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf32","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/contemporary-islamic-scholar-rethinks-the-concept-of-education","currSlug":"/media-center/contemporary-islamic-scholar-rethinks-the-concept-of-education","title":"Contemporary Islamic Scholar Rethinks The Concept Of Education"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
