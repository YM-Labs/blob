Hence, across the region explicit family policies are rare and do not meet international standards, like maternity leave.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Noor went on to address the economic impact of family breakdowns saying, &#x201C;Failing to support and protect family relationships results in eventual family breakdowns which are extremely costly in solely economic terms. The macro socio-economic implications of such breakdowns need to be quantified transparently with regards to their subsequent burden on the economy and the taxpayers.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Executive Director, Noor Al Jehani went on to outline DIFI&#x2019;s commitment to the 20th anniversary of the International Year of the Family (2014) through this year&#x2019;s Doha Conference that will be held on April 16-17 in Qatar, under the patronage of Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Chairperson of Qatar Foundation.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/22_02_2014%20DIFI%20NY%20PR_En_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf57","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/difi-calls-for-policy-changes-regarding-arab-family-unit","currSlug":"/media-center/difi-calls-for-policy-changes-regarding-arab-family-unit","title":"DIFI Calls for Policy Changes Regarding Arab Family Unit"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
