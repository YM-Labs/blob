Libraries Without Borders developed the Ideas Box, a portable multi-media toolkit facilitating and strengthening access to non-formal education for vulnerable communities such as refugees; while eduTechnoz offered the game-based educational online resources for children to learn Arabic. <br>\n <br>\n The collaboration facilitated by WISE, part of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF), means the resources of both companies have now been deployed in Jordan: one in Azraq refugee camp and one in a community center in Hashmi Shamali, Amman. Since the end of March 2016, children aged 6-10 have been able to access eduTechnoz educational content, monitor their progress and collect badges through the Ideas Box. <br>\n <br>\n Long-term crises, such as the conflict in Syria, have put the education of entire generations in danger, diminishing human capital crucial to rebuilding a war-torn country. Children who experience violence and uncertainty at a young age must be given the means to obtain a sense of normality and happiness in their lives. For these reasons, innovative, game-based education caters to both the educational and emotional needs of refugee children.<br>\n <br>\n Libraries Without Borders and eduTechnoz decided to work together after their representatives met within the framework of the WISE Accelerator Program, which offers opportunities for innovative education projects to scale-up and extend their services. The WISE facilitated project is now generating a meaningful impact for the most vulnerable children in need of help.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/01%2007%2016%20eduTechoz%20%20IdeasBox%20Collab%20PR%20EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf42","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-creates-learning-opportunities-for-syrian-refugees","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-creates-learning-opportunities-for-syrian-refugees","title":"WISE Creates Learning Opportunities For Syrian Refugees"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
