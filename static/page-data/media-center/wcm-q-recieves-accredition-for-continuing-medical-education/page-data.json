Now WCM-Q has become the very first institution in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region to receive the same accreditation and to have the rights and responsibility to designate AMA PRA Category 1 Credits&#x2122; (American Medical Association Physician&apos;s Recognition Award). In addition, WCM-Q is the first institution in the whole of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to receive ACCME accreditation.<br>\n <br>\n At a ceremony held to announce the accreditation success, WCM-Q Dean Dr. Javaid Sheikh said: &#x201C;This milestone is a recognition of the commitment of WCM-Q and its dedicated faculty and staff to a high quality health education in adherence with international best practices. It is also an international recognition of the quality and value of programs being offered by WCM-Q to help physicians and healthcare practitioners locally, regionally and internationally to continually improve their skills and knowledge so that they can provide the very best standards of healthcare to their patients.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n WCM-Q also has accreditation to provide continuing medical education and continuing professional development from the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170212%20English%20WCM-Q%20becomes%20amongst%20the%20world-s%20first%20non-US%20institutions%20to%20gain%20ACCME%20accreditation.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf20","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-recieves-accredition-for-continuing-medical-education","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-recieves-accredition-for-continuing-medical-education","title":"WCM-Q Recieves Accredition for Continuing Medical Education"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
