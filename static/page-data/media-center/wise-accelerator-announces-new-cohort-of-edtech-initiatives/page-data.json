During the summit, representatives of the selected initiatives will take part in workshops, attend master classes, and participate in pitching sessions.\nStavros Yiannouka, CEO of WISE, said: “We have faith in this year’s founders potential in transforming education on a large scale and at a global level. This year’s cohort is tackling tough challenges in education that range from helping teachers reduce planning time through peer-to-peer support to tackling the global labor shortage in the medical sector by providing scalable and quality content for training workers in the medical field.”\nThe eight initiatives are: Kamkalima, a K-12 school platform that supports the teaching and learning of Arabic language; Teacherly, which aims to create teams of teachers with collaborative lesson planning and peer-to-peer coaching; Botter, a gamified and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered language teaching chatbot; Medics.Academy, which aims to address the needs of global health systems through scalable education; Wiloki, an adaptive platform that leverages artificial intelligence to support parents in teaching their children; OXED, which launched Wumbox, an online and offline adaptive educational platform for children; AskMyClass: an affordable social-emotional learning assistant for teachers; and Livox, an alternative communication software for non-verbal people to communicate and learn.\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/n58RjuH92VDQdMqoGv0g0/58edb723426fdf9394ed7e9864554d31/Kamkalima.jpg\" alt=\"Kamkalima\">\nAtif Mahmood, Founder and CEO of Teacherly, said: “When you make the decision to start a startup, it is like a roller coaster – you have your ups and downs. But what has helped us remain focused is believing that our product is the best, knowing our customers, and a burning desire to make a difference and succeed. When applying to WISE for this cohort, we knew the WISE network and the program would help us accomplish our global ambitions. Now, after being accepted, the entire team at Teacherly – with the support of WISE – can start working towards our goal of scaling the project and helping clusters of teachers globally.”</p>\n<p>Aldo de Pape, Founder and CEO of TeachPitch, a member of the program’s 2015-16 cohort and member of the selection committee, said: \"I learned a great deal from being on the selection committee this year. I am very grateful for the opportunity to participate in the selection process of the 2019-2020 WISE Accelerator Committee. I take my hat off to all the team that applied. It is my sincere hope that all of them thrive in improving the global state of education. Please do not give up – the world needs people like you.”\nFor this year’s cohort, WISE and the World Innovation Summit for Health (WISH) – also an initiative of QF – have partnered to leverage their respective networks and expertise in supporting Medics.Academy, one of the selected ventures which is at the intersection of EdTech and healthtech.\nSultana Afdhal, CEO of WISH said: “We are delighted to be working in partnership with WISE, this year, to support Medics.Academy – a brand new, tech-based healthcare innovation that aims to help medical professionals by offering them education online. Within the diverse Qatar Foundation ecosystem, this collaboration presents us with a great opportunity to contribute to current knowledge at the intersection of health and medical education to support and optimise the delivery of health solutions around the world.”\nThe WISE Accelerator supports the development of innovative education technology initiatives with high potential to make a positive impact. The selected initiatives receive support from mentors and WISE partners to scale up their startups, improve their international visibility, and identify potential partners, donors, and investors through networking opportunities organized by WISE.\nFor more information about these initiatives, please visit: www.wise-qatar.org/wise-accelerator</p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1Q9bYkB4MlluoJf54ikiCf","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-accelerator-announces-new-cohort-of-edtech-initiatives","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-accelerator-announces-new-cohort-of-edtech-initiatives","title":"WISE Accelerator Announces New Cohort Of EdTech Initiatives"}}}
