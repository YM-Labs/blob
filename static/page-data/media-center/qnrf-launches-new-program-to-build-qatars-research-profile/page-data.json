Research Fund (QNRF), a member of Qatar Foundation, has announced the launch of a new program – the Researchers Exchange and Mobility Program (REMP).</p>\n<p>The REMP is designed to help students and employees build their employability skills and strengthen their research capabilities through international research collaborations. The program aims to raise the interdisciplinary research profile of Qatar by focusing on the four pillars of the Qatar National Research Strategy (QNRS): Energy and Environment; Computer Science and ICT; Health; and Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities. </p>\n<p>Dr. Abdul Sattar Al-Taie, Executive Director of QNRF, said: “As a part of our commitment to develop local human capital, we strive to encourage our researchers to tackle and overcome the major research challenges that are present not only in the region, but around the world. To that end, research institutions globally are advancing innovative technologies and building knowledge to address these challenges, and through the REMP, we want our local talent to be at the center of these efforts.</p>\n<p>“I am certain that this new program will be received with a lot of enthusiasm by Qatar’s academic and research community as well as our students who will make the most out of this novel opportunity.” </p>\n<p>Along with building the research culture in Qatar, the program will also help cement relations of local researchers and institutions with the international research and development network. Moreover, it will also produce tangible research outcomes to help bridge the gap between academia and industry.</p>\n<p>The call for applications opened on October 8 and will conclude on November 18. Interested Qatari nationals and eligible residents are encouraged to apply.\nFor more information, please visit: <a href=\"https://www.qnrf.org\">www.qnrf.org</a>.</p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9NHeGW4IQNvLsXtqpPNQl","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qnrf-launches-new-program-to-build-qatars-research-profile","currSlug":"/media-center/qnrf-launches-new-program-to-build-qatars-research-profile","title":"QNRF Launches New Program to Build Qatar’s Research Profile"}}}
