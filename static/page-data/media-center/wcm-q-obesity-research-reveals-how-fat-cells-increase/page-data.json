The role of SIRT1 is well understood in hypertrophy but not in hyperplasia, which is where Dr. Mazloum&#x2019;s research was focused. <br>\n <br>\n Using mice precursor fat cells with artificially lowered levels of SIRT1, the WCM-Q researchers were able to confirm that the protein does indeed play a key role in limiting accumulation of metabolically dysfunctional hyperplastic adipose (fat) cells. <br>\n <br>\n The study has now been published in the renowned medical journal The Journal of Biological Chemistry.<br>\n <br>\n The study, entitled &#x2018;SIRT1 Limits Adipocyte Hyperplasia Through c-Myc Inhibition&#x2019; was aided by funding from the Biomedical Research Program (BMRP) program of Qatar Foundation, which supports the research effort at WCM-Q. <br>\n <br>\n Other researchers who contributed to the project are Aisha Madani, Ahmad Hani, Muna Al-Noubi, Neha Goswami, Hisham Ben Hamidane, Anja M.
