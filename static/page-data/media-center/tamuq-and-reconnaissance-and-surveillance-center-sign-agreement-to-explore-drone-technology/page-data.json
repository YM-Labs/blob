The technology is used for airborne surveillance needs in maritime border control missions and for supporting operations to secure Qatar&#x2019;s hydrocarbon resources.<br>\n <br>\n Signing on behalf of the RSC was center director General Khalid bin Ahmad Al-Kuwari, who said the new partnership represented a significant step forward in contributing to Qatar&#x2019;s national vision of being a knowledge-based economy and helping to secure the continued safety and prosperity of the State of Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n The partnership grew out of the RSC&#x2019;s contributions to the Engineering Heroes Drone Camp, a STEM program for Qatari students hosted in April by Texas A&amp;M at Qatar and Maersk Oil Qatar. Al-Kuwari spoke with Qatari students who participated in the program and encouraged them to study hard to attain the knowledge needed to support technology for Qatar&#x2019;s national defense, saying that engineering is a calling for Qatar. He and other officers from the RSC also gave the students a preview of drone technology recently adopted by Qatar&#x2019;s military forces.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Texas%20A&amp;M-Q%20MOU%20RSC-%20Eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf72","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/tamuq-and-reconnaissance-and-surveillance-center-sign-agreement-to-explore-drone-technology","currSlug":"/media-center/tamuq-and-reconnaissance-and-surveillance-center-sign-agreement-to-explore-drone-technology","title":"TAMUQ and Reconnaissance and Surveillance Center Sign Agreement To Explore Drone Technology"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
