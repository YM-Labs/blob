The product has been developed in Europe by a team of scientists and its pre-clinical and clinical development has been supported by Michael J. Fox Foundation. <br>\n<br>\nUsing the team’s novel analysis techniques, the researchers at HBKU will assess the product’s ability to engage with the target, alpha-synuclein. QBRI’s scientists will explore novel biomarkers discovered by them that facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson’s disease and use the technique they have developed at HBKU to assess themagnitude of target engagement of this new immunotherapy-based compound.<br>\n<br>\nCommenting on his team’s involvement with AFFiRiS AG, Dr. El-Agnaf said: “Parkinson’s disease remains a debilitating medical condition for which there is currently no cure. Treatments that help patients with Parkinson’s typically work with those individuals who were diagnosed with the disease when it is still in early stages. Despite good symptomatic treatment options, there is a substantial need for disease modifying agents and alternatives to the existing treatment options. With so many people affected by Parkinson’s disease around the world, QBRI is committed to collaborative research with dedicated partners from around the world, such as AFFiRiS AG and others working across Europe on contributing to better understanding of the mode of action, with a view to helping achieve the next landmark in Parkinson’s disease cure. <br>\n<br>\nTo find out more about research at HBKU, please visit <a href=\"http://www.hbku.edu.qa\">www.hbku.edu.qa</a> <br>\n<br>\nFor the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170424%20-%20Dr%20Omar%20El-Agnaf%20-%20EN%20Final.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n<br></p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf52","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qbri-team-selected-for-parkinsons-clinical-trials","currSlug":"/media-center/qbri-team-selected-for-parkinsons-clinical-trials","title":"QBRI Team Selected for Parkinson’s Clinical Trials"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
