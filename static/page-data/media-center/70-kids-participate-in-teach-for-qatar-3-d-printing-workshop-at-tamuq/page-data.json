Building the LEGO parts was the most intensive day as the students were asked to use the LEGO parts in a competition that challenged them to use their 3-D printed LEGO parts to build a bridge. A basic bridge design was given and students were divided into small groups to work together on building their own bridges. The winning team was the one that created the most durable bridge. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/DSCN0202%5B2%5D%5B1%5D.JPG.jpeg\" alt=\"DSCN0202[2][1].JPG\" height=\"3864\" width=\"5152\"><br>\n The summer camps are part of Texas A&amp;M at Qatar&#x2019;s STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) outreach initiatives to prepare young students for future studies in STEM topics, which are critical to Qatar&#x2019;s future success. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/70%20kids%20participate%20in%20Teach%20for%20Qatar%203-D%20Printing%20Workshop%20at%20Texas%20A&amp;M%20at%20Qatar%20-%20English.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf35","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/70-kids-participate-in-teach-for-qatar-3-d-printing-workshop-at-tamuq","currSlug":"/media-center/70-kids-participate-in-teach-for-qatar-3-d-printing-workshop-at-tamuq","title":"70 Kids Participate in Teach for Qatar 3-D Printing Workshop at TAMUQ"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
