Beyond learning the words &#x2013; verbs, nouns, and adjectives &#x2013; the real challenge is going from theory to practice, building discourse competence. At the Language Center, we recognize these challenges and seek to teach our students beyond the classroom, providing them with interesting and authentic contexts to practice their target language. We are thankful to the Ambassadors and foreign diplomats who visited the classrooms to engage with our students. &#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The Language Center at TII currently offers seven language programs at various proficiency levels, namely Arabic, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin Chinese, German, and Italian.<br>\n <br>\n To find out more about the programs offered by the Language Center at HBKU&#x2019;s TII, visit <a href=\"http://www.tii.qa\"><strong>www.tii.qa</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf82","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbkus-tii-hosts-foreign-dignitaries-for-diplomatic-week","currSlug":"/media-center/hbkus-tii-hosts-foreign-dignitaries-for-diplomatic-week","title":"HBKU’s TII Hosts Foreign Dignitaries for “Diplomatic Week”"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
