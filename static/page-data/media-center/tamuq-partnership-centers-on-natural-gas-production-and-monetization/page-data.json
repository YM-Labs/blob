Elbashir, director of the TEES Gas and Fuels Research Center. &#x201C;The partnership between the TEES Gas and Fuels Research Center and the Texas A&amp;M Energy Institute provides an excellent opportunity for the university to now lead in the shale oil and gas era. This partnership will expand the portfolio of the GFRC&#x2019;s activities in supporting Qatar&#x2019;s gas production and processing plants.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n It is anticipated that new approaches will be discovered, previously unavailable research opportunities will be presented, and diverse sets of individuals will gain mastery of concepts through innovative educational programs.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We very much welcome this partnership,&#x201D; said Stratos Pistikopoulos, interim co-director and deputy director of the Texas A&amp;M Energy Institute. &#x201C;This will allow us to create synergies and opportunities between our two organizations in the strategically important energy space of natural and shale gas and fuels. Further, this will strengthen the existing relationships between our Qatar campus and main campus for energy research, education and training.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The Texas A&amp;M Energy Institute is a joint institute of Texas A&amp;M and the Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station (TEES). The Texas A&amp;M Energy Institute engages student, faculty and staff researchers in the study and development of innovative technologies and policies for energy production and energy conservation. <br>\n <br>\n The TEES Gas and Fuels Research Center is a multidisciplinary research center that is led by Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar and involves 31 professors from the Qatar campus and Texas A&amp;M&#x2019;s main campus. The center draws on experience from different engineering programs including chemical engineering, petroleum engineering, material engineering and mechanical engineering.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Texas%20A_26M%20at%20Qatar%20partnership%20focuses%20on%20natural%20gas%20production%20and%20monetization%20-%20English.pdf\">here</a>.&#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf9","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/tamuq-partnership-centers-on-natural-gas-production-and-monetization","currSlug":"/media-center/tamuq-partnership-centers-on-natural-gas-production-and-monetization","title":"TAMUQ Partnership Centers on Natural Gas Production and Monetization"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
