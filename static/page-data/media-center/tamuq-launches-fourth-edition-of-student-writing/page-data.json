Malav&#xE9; said: &#x201C;We pride ourselves on creating well-rounded engineers who will lead Qatar&#x2019;s transformation into a modern, knowledge-based society. Best Writing celebrates the talent and creativity of our Aggie engineers who are critical and creative thinkers and writers. This book proves that there&#x2019;s more to engineers than just science and math: There&#x2019;s also creativity, innovation and passion.&#x201D; <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/DSC_1237a-17.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_1237a.jpg\" height=\"424\" width=\"640\"><br>\n Nadim Wahbeh, who has two pieces published this year, agreed. &#x201C;I feel that Best Writing allows people to share their work and get an insight from others. It also delivers a point: Anyone can write, regardless of their background or their major in university. Writing does not require much &#x2014; it only requires motivation, a pen and a paper. Writing can take the writer and the reader to a different world where self-expression is its number-one motto.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n This year&#x2019;s book features more Arabic poetry than previous editions, as well as open letters from Texas A&amp;M faculty and staff. There are also a number of pieces on current events in this year&#x2019;s publication, making it &#x201C;very of its time,&#x201D; according to co-editor Dr. Amy Hodges. &#x201C;Best Writing shows that TAMUQ students take seriously their roles as both citizens and engineers.&#x201D; <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/DSC_1242a-17.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_1242a.jpg\" height=\"424\" width=\"640\"><br>\n The book also features photos taken by TAMUQ students, including Fatima Al-Janahi whose photo of AlWakra Souq is featured on the book&#x2019;s cover.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Texas%20A-26M%20at%20Qatar%20launches%20fourth%20edition%20of%20student%20writing.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf5","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/tamuq-launches-fourth-edition-of-student-writing","currSlug":"/media-center/tamuq-launches-fourth-edition-of-student-writing","title":"TAMUQ Launches Fourth Edition of Student Writing"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
