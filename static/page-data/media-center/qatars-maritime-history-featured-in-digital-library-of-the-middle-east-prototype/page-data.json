Documents include maps, pearl fishery reports, academic articles, and video and audio recordings of traditional sea music from Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We are very pleased to be a part of the launch of the DLME, which will bring worldwide access to the fascinating history and heritage of the Middle East. The DLME platform enables us to reach a wider audience, and make the history of the Arabian Gulf region more accessible to all,&#x201D; Dr. Onley said. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Onley is a founding editor of the Journal of Arabian Studies, and was director of the Centre for Gulf Studies at Exeter University during 2005&#x2013;2012. He also held visiting professorships at Georgetown University in Qatar, the American University of Sharjah, the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, and Qatar University.<br>\n <br>\n Other exhibitions currently available on the DLME focus on Egyptian and Near Eastern female figurines, and on how the DLME supports cultural heritage preservation.<br>\n <br>\n The DLME will ultimately encompass text, video, photographs, archives, manuscripts, 3D data, and maps illuminating the region&#x2019;s history over 12 millennia, curated by scholars and specialists. The first exhibitions can be seen at dlme.clir.org. <br>\n The QDL is the result of a partnership between QNL and the British Library. It hosts over one million pages from the British Library&#x2019;s vast collection of historical material (records, maps, images, books) on the Arabian Gulf region, and is freely available online worldwide.
