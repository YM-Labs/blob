The development is now ready for industry application, allowing visitors to the website the ability to easily and quickly find answers to&#xA0;their questions on the forum to save time.<br>\n <br>\n QCRI joined forces with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x2019;s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (MIT-CSAIL) to develop novel algorithms for language processing on the data provided by Qatar Living. <br>\n <br>\n The QCRI technology is based on machine learning and deep linguistic and semantic analysis, enabling machines to understand questions and comments by forum users. By carrying out intelligent exploration of textual data, computers can analyze user requests and find key information among the thousands of comments. With the introduction of semantic processing technology, internet users are offered a number of benefits including an increase in search effectiveness and accuracy, and the possibility of automatically deriving the veracity of the information they receive.<br>\n <img src=\"https://cdn.qf.com.qa/app/media/8453\" alt=\"QCRI.jpg\"><br>\n Natural Language Processing has been incorporated into the Qatar Living website over the past week. The foundation research was presented at last week&#x2019;s annual QCRI-MIT CSAIL research projects review meeting in Doha. <br>\n <br>\n Following the launch, the research teams have begun developing a new type of Arabic language search technology and the next generation of semantic-based text search, featuring customized user interfaces, measuring mechanisms for data reliability, as well as identification of malicious users and near-duplicate search queries.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160327_QCRI%20MIT%20Qatar%20Living%20Release_EN_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf81","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qcri-collaborates-with-qatar-living-to-improve-online-search","currSlug":"/media-center/qcri-collaborates-with-qatar-living-to-improve-online-search","title":"QCRI Collaborates With Qatar Living to Improve Online Search"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
