Stakeholders from both the public and private sector (and especially in developing countries) are often not aware of, or are not sufficiently informed about, these systems.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Essentially, TradeLab will provide useful knowledge for policymakers--in Qatar and around the world--about negotiating, implementing and enforcing trade and investment treaties, along with access to global experts with substantial direct experience who can advise on specific issues and problems,&#x201D; said GU-Q Director of Research, Dr. John Crist.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story on Georgetown&apos;s website, please <a href=\"https://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/news-events/news/gu-q-set-lead-tradelab-research-project\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5qf53","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/gu-q-set-to-lead-tradelab-research-project","currSlug":"/media-center/gu-q-set-to-lead-tradelab-research-project","title":"GU-Q Set to Lead TradeLab Research Project"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
