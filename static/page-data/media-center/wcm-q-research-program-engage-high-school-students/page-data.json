She interned in the laboratory of Dr. Karsten Suhre, professor of physiology and biophysics and director of the bioinformatics core.<br>\n <br>\n The 17-year-old, who plans to apply to WCM-Q to study medicine, said: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve done other research programs in the past in Boston, but this was one that was at home and something I could do during the summer vacation before school starts again.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n She added: &#x201C;I want to apply to Cornell in the future; so being able to come and work in the laboratories before my decision was really useful. In the future, I want to be a physician specializing in sports medicine and taking these internship programs will also help me to pursue research interests on the side as well.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n While at WCM-Q, Mashael was taught the Western blot pipetting technique, which is used to detect specific proteins in a cell.<br>\n <br>\n As part of the program, which is administered by WCM-Q&#x2019;s Research Division, the interns also take classes on time-management techniques, self-directed study skills and how to prepare strong college applications.<br>\n <br>\n Christy Poppe, senior research training specialist at WCM-Q, said the aim of the internship scheme was to encourage potential scientists and biomedical researchers to pursue the subject as a career, and so ultimately increase research capacity within Qatar, fulfilling one of the goals of Qatar national Vision 2030.<br>\n <br>\n The Research Internship for National High School Students program targets Qatari nationals who are 16 years old and above. The program also counts towards students&#x2019; voluntary community service hours, with students who complete the course logging between 50 and 100 hours of service, depending on whether they take the two-week or four-week option.<br>\n <br>\n For more information about internships and training programs that are available at WCM-Q, visit: <br>\n <a href=\"https://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/research/research-training-programs/overview\">https://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/research/research-training-programs/overview.</a><br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170827%20English%20High%20school%20students%20head%20to%20the%20laboratory%20for%20a%20summer%20....pdf\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf23","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-research-program-engage-high-school-students","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-research-program-engage-high-school-students","title":"WCM-Q Research Program Engage High School Students"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
