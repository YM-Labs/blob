He is best remembered for his performance in the 1971 Copa del Rey (Spanish Cup Final) against Valencia, when he scored the winning goal in a game that ended 4-3 to FC Barcelona.</p>\n <p>His experiences in the youth side have stayed with him, and he said, &#x201C;When you are a young player you receive a lot from the coaches and you learn respect, to work as a team and that means you must listen and take care of others. You learn punctuality, to think with others. There are some values that you can transfer very easily with football.&#x201D;</p>\n <p>Commenting on Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s partnership with FC Barcelona, Mr Alfonseda said, &#x201C;We must learn from one another. If you can implement something from Barcelona here and we, as Barcelona Football Club, can implement something from you in our country, in our institution, as a club, and in our children. I think when you get a kind of cooperation like this, both sides must see what is possible to get as values from one side to another. I think it is the kind of cooperation that can support and help the world.&#x201D;</p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf89","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/ramon-visits-qf","currSlug":"/media-center/ramon-visits-qf","title":"Ramón Visits QF"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
