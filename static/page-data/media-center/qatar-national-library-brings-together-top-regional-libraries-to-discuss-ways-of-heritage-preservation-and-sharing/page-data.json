The two-day symposium, which builds on the great success of the training workshops in 2013 and 2014, this year focused on Arab Authority Control - how library catalog and bibliographic information can be organized in Arabic. The symposium took place at the Hamad Bin Khalifa University Student Centre within Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s Education City, and attracted more than 40 attendees. <br>\n <br>\n Delegates included senior representatives, professors and librarians from a number of libraries, heritage centers and universities including Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Bahrain, Yemen and the USA. <br>\n <br>\n The symposium provided the participants with information, tools and resources that can be used for cataloging in their respective libraries, as well as to develop a common understanding of the concepts and tools among the contributors to the WDL so that the records they contribute are better and useful for all. <br>\n <img width=\"620\" height=\"426\" alt=\"QNL logo NEW WHITE.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QNL%20logo%20NEW%20WHITE-17.jpg\"><br>\n WDL was created by the Library of Congress, and reinforced by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). <br>\n <br>\n Libraries and cultural institutions from around the world contribute to WDL, led by the Library of Congress, by sharing their cultural treasures to create a digital fountain of knowledge.
