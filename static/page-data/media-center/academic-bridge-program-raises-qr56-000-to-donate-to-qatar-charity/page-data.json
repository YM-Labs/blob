The money will go towards building an elementary school in Somalia. <br>\n <br>\n This is the second time that the ABP has raised funds for a school; in 2011, the ABP managed to raise QR30,000 for Reach Out To Asia (ROTA) to rebuild a school in Pakistan. <br>\n <br>\n Fundraising started at the very beginning of this academic year (2013-2014), when Moza Al Boainain, Assistant Director for Students Services at the ABP sought the help of her hugely popular &#x2019;Social Services and Volunteering&#x2018; club to raise funds for a worthy cause&#x2212;to build a school in Somalia. <br>\n <br>\n The school was identified by her and Qatar Charity as a viable charity project.With the help of the club and the Student Services department a number of activities were launched to raise awareness amongst ABP students and faculty of the needs of others and to encourage people to donate to the cause.One of the projects was a bake sale and the other was the ABP Charity Carnival that took place on Sunday, 30 March at the Las building in Education City.<br>\n <br>\n Among those who donated to the &#x2018;build a school in Somalia&#x2019; cause were, Mamig Lebanese and Armenian Restaurant in Katara and Red Velvet Cupcakery, also in Katara, who donated prizes, and Qatar Star Catering, who donated lunch boxes.<br>\n The carnival was packed with games and activities, such as: face-painting; a mega slide; food &amp; gifts; flowers; and hand crafted boxes and cards made by ABP students.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/ABP%20Charity%20Carnival_EN.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf58","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/academic-bridge-program-raises-qr56-000-to-donate-to-qatar-charity","currSlug":"/media-center/academic-bridge-program-raises-qr56-000-to-donate-to-qatar-charity","title":"Academic Bridge Program Raises QR56,000 to Donate to Qatar Charity"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
