Since it was inaugurated in 2012, with the support of local industry, it has taken up topics ranging from media audiences and social media to building Brand Qatar. It is a unique venue that brings together media executives and senior staff with professionals from adverting, public relations, and marketing research along with faculty members and students from Northwestern,&#x201D; said Dennis. <br>\n <br>\n The session on November 8 will address challenges media companies face when expanding beyond national borders. Panelists will explore what legal, operational, and marketing obstacles media companies should overcome before entering a new market, and will discuss examples of how media companies have solved these issues and achieved success in new markets. They will also share their thoughts on opportunities that regional policy-makers might take advantage of to encourage and enhance the regional expansion of media enterprises.<br>\n <br>\n NU-Q established the QMIF in 2012 as part of a wider effort to provide thought leadership, educate future media and communications leaders in Qatar and the Middle East, and produce ground-breaking research on industry trends and media consumption in the region.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QMIF%20Advance_FINAL.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf17","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-brings-together-national-media-professionals","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-brings-together-national-media-professionals","title":"NU-Q Brings Together National Media Professionals"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
