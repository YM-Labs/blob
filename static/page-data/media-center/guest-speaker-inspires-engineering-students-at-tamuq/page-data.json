She was unofficially the second Sudanese family in Brisbane. &#x201C;I was not your typical Australian girl,&#x201D; she said. That otherness was on display when she announced to her mother her dream to be the first female black Muslim Formula One driver. <br>\n <br>\n At 16, Abdel-Magied founded Youth Without Borders, a youth-led organization that empowers young people to work together to change their communities positively. She started a mobile lending library in the jungles of Indonesia, an initiative to encourage Muslim girls to play soccer called &#x201C;Shin pads and Hijabs&#x201D; and a free engineering camp called &#x201C;SPARK.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Abdel-Magied, through her experience with Youth Without Borders, realized to &#x201C;never underestimate the impact a single individual&#x2014;you&#x2014;can make. Provide other people a leg up. Giving opportunities to people who may not share our background is really important. The reality is we all can&#x2019;t necessarily change the world, but we can change the world around us.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/TAMUQ%20at%20Qatar%20ENGLISH.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5qf70","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/guest-speaker-inspires-engineering-students-at-tamuq","currSlug":"/media-center/guest-speaker-inspires-engineering-students-at-tamuq","title":"Guest Speaker Inspires Engineering Students At Tamuq"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
