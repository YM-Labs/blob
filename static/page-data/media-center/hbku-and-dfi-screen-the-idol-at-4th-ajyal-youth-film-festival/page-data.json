The audience included members of Qatar&#x2019;s hearing and visually impaired communities.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/HBKU%20CHSS%20team%20involved%20with%20the%20project.jpg\" alt=\"HBKU CHSS team involved with the project.jpg\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"><br>\n Students in CHSS&#x2019;s Master of Arts in Audiovisual Translation program developed the additional content used in audio descriptions and subtitles for a special &#x201C;trans-adapted&#x201D; version of the film. The special screening was presented in Arabic with Arabic audio descriptions, pre-recorded Arabic sign-language interpretation, and enriched subtitles in Arabic and English. <br>\n <br>\n Visually impaired audiences were able to fully experience the film through sound alone, thanks to the inclusion of audio descriptions of the film&#x2019;s visual elements. Attendees who were hard-of-hearing, or who had difficulty processing speech, were able to enjoy the film through subtitles enriched with detailed information about sound effects and music.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Amal Mohammed Al-Malki, Dean of CHSS, said: &#x201C;Inclusivity is a cornerstone of translation and interpretation services. The idea that something should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their ability to understand the language of origin or whether they have a visual or hearing impairment, is a frequently cited reason for why people get into the field of audiovisual translation.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n She added: &#x201C;Our Masters of Arts in Audiovisual Translation students have done a tremendous job ensuring The Idol can be enjoyed by all members of the community in Qatar, and we are very grateful to DFI for giving us the opportunity to collaborate with them for this special Ajyal Youth Film Festival screening.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Fatma Al Remaihi, Festival Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Doha Film Institute, said: &#x201C;We would like to thank Dr. Amal Al Malki, and the wonderful team of students and faculty at TII for their whole-hearted efforts in delivering an uplifting experience of The Idol, a real-life story of hope and positivity that we are proud to have supported. Ajyal is a festival for the community, and we are committed to ensuring that it connects with all segments of the society. We introduced inclusive screenings last year to remarkable response from the community, and we are delighted to present a trans-adapted version of a deeply inspiring film at Ajyal 2016. This highlights our efforts to use film as a medium to raise awareness, spread positivity and hope, and enhance its accessibility for all.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/161204%20The%20Idol%20-%20EN.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf22","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-and-dfi-screen-the-idol-at-4th-ajyal-youth-film-festival","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-and-dfi-screen-the-idol-at-4th-ajyal-youth-film-festival","title":"HBKU and DFI Screen “The Idol” at 4th Ajyal Youth Film Festival"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
