The second phase examined the eight case studies of innovations, successfully scaled in a number of countries, to determine the factors that enabled the success of these innovations. This year, GDHI will present its third phase of research at WISH 2016.&#xA0;</div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>\n In this regard, Mathew Harris, clinical senior lecturer in Public Health Medicine at the Institute of Global Health Innovation and the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, also the project lead for GDHI, said: &#x201C;The influence of the WISH conference is significant. This conference presents a remarkable opportunity for the collective intellectual power of senior health policymakers from around the world to come together at a common platform and attend to tricky subjects like the design and delivery of healthcare systems.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The WISH 2016 Summit, to be held from 29th to 30th November in Doha, will feature seven ground-breaking Research Forums that highlight and address some of the world&#x2019;s most pressing healthcare challenges.
