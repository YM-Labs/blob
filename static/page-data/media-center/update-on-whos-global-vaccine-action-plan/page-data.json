Country involvement in the process reinforces a key tenet of the GVAP, which is to increase national ownership of immunization programs.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24qf52","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/update-on-whos-global-vaccine-action-plan","currSlug":"/media-center/update-on-whos-global-vaccine-action-plan","title":"Update On WHO's Global Vaccine Action Plan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
