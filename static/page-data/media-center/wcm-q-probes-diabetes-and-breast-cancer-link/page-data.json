We believe this review indicates there is indeed a direct link between diabetes and increased breast cancer risk, its progression, metastasis and relapse. Better understanding of this link will be extremely beneficial to patients, hopefully improving survival rates and the quality of life among affected individuals.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The study explains that, as diabetes progresses, the body&#x2019;s metabolism undergoes fundamental changes, with elevated levels of lipids (fats), insulin and glucose in the blood. These metabolic changes, in turn, disrupt and alter the normal functions of cells, causing damage to the DNA and the cell&#x2019;s own structures, uncontrolled cell proliferation, and inhibition of a process called apoptosis, a normal form of programmed cell death that is a key part of cellular development and renewal. Inhibition of apoptosis in breast cancer cells serves to initiate or promote the growth of breast tumors. <br>\n <br>\n It also discusses the effects of diabetes therapies on cancer risk, finding that drugs that target high blood glucose appear to induce cell death in cancer cells. While insulin therapy appears to increase breast cancer risk and support breast cancer progression, drugs that increase the body&#x2019;s sensitivity to insulin, such as the widely prescribed metformin, have significant anti-cancer potential. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/181014%20English%20WCM-Q%20research%20probes%20link%20between%20diabetes%20and%20breast%20ca....pdf\">here</a><br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf15","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-probes-diabetes-and-breast-cancer-link","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-probes-diabetes-and-breast-cancer-link","title":"WCM-Q Probes Diabetes And Breast Cancer Link"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
