Participating in Earth Hour comes in a long line of initiatives. <br>\n <br>\n When Vodafone launched in 2009, the company immediately introduced biodegradable scratch cards. Shortly after, Vodafone launched the first Mobile recycling program in all its retail stores, and started recycling all unused posters, flyers and brochures that become obsolete at the end of promotions. <br>\n <br>\n Vodafone Qatar also believes in giving customers environmentally friendly communication options, and since 2011 the company started offering solar-energy-powered mobile phones, and solar energy phone chargers. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf41","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/vodafone-qatar-celebrates-earth-hour-across-its-retail-stores","currSlug":"/media-center/vodafone-qatar-celebrates-earth-hour-across-its-retail-stores","title":"Vodafone Qatar Celebrates Earth Hour Across its Retail Stores"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
