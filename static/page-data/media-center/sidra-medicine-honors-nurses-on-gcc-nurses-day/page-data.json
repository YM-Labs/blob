You are entrusted with returning a person back to health. There&#x2019;s no greater responsibility and we are starting to see the community in Qatar recognize the value of nursing as a career. My colleagues and I spend a lot of time going to schools and meeting with students and their parents to help dispel any lingering misconceptions and encourage more people to study to become a nurse.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Maryam Al Neama, a nurse who works in the children&#x2019;s Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) at Sidra Medicine added, &#x201C;Nurses are essential members of any care team and are the first point of contact for patients and their families, positioning them as the voice of the patient. I have personally found the experience humbling and rewarding. The growing need for quality patient-centric care in Qatar makes now the best time for more Qatari nurses to join the ranks of this esteemed profession.&#x201D; <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Sidra%20Medicine%20-%20Nurse%20Maryam%20Al%20Neama.2-24.jpg\" alt=\"Sidra Medicine - Nurse Maryam Al Neama.2.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n To read more, click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/GCC%20Nurse%20Day%20release%20-%20ENG%20-%20FINAL%2013%20March%202018.pdf\">here</a>.</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf57","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-medicine-honors-nurses-on-gcc-nurses-day","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-medicine-honors-nurses-on-gcc-nurses-day","title":"Sidra Medicine honors nurses on GCC Nurses Day"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
