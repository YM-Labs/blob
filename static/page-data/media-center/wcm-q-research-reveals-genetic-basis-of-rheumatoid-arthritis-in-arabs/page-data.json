They then worked with researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, one of the world&#x2019;s foremost genomics research labs, to analyze the genetic data of Arab populations in comparison with European and East Asian populations in relation to susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo2-24.jpg\" alt=\"null\" width=\"560\" height=\"300\"><br>\n The team found that mutations in a gene called HLA-DRB1 are associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk in Arab populations just as is the case with Europeans and East Asians, suggesting broad similarities in the genetic structure of RA across ethnic groups. However, the study also identified two additional genes that are associated with rheumatoid arthritis in Arabs but are not in Europeans and East Asians. <br>\n <br>\n Rheumatoid arthritis is a potentially debilitating autoimmune disease characterized by very painful inflammation of the joints, particularly in the hands and feet. RA can also affect larger joints, the skin, lungs, kidneys and the heart and blood vessels, among other parts of the body. The cause of RA is not fully understood and there is currently no cure so treatment is focused on managing the disease.<br>\n <br>\n The study, entitled &#x2018;A multi-national Arab genome-wide association study identifies new genetic associations for Rheumatoid Arthritis&#x2019;, has now been published in the prestigious medical journal Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology. The study is part of a wider research project entitled &#x2018;Genetic Studies of Rheumatoid Arthritis in some Arab States&#x2019; that was made possible by NPRP grant 4-344-3-105 from the Qatar National Research Fund, a member of Qatar Foundation. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170208%20English%20WCM-Q%20research%20reveals%20genetic%20basis%20of%20rheumatoid%20arthritis%20in%20Arabs.pdf\">here</a>.&#xA0;<br>\n </strong><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf25","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-research-reveals-genetic-basis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-arabs","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-research-reveals-genetic-basis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-arabs","title":"WCM-Q Research Reveals Genetic Basis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in Arabs"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
