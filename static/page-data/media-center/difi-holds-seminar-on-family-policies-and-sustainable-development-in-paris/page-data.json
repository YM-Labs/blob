This belief not only comes from DIFI’s vision and mission, but has also been proven by scientific evidence.\n“Our collaboration with the Permanent Mission of the State of Qatar to the UNESCO highlights the centrality of family policies in achieving the objectives of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and emphasizes the priority of family approach in the design of programs.\n“During the Paris seminar, we highlighted the importance of family policies in achieving sustainable development, focusing on three main themes – fertility policies, work-family balance policies, and marital rehabilitation programs – and their importance at national, regional, and international levels.”\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/1ScqMe3PN4vRXnVWTuSfyy/947e390de6f661a8848bc483c3a7520a/Image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image1\">\nThe first session addressed fertility policies and fertility rates both globally and in the Arab world, while the second session highlighted work-family balance and its role in the sustainability of the marriage institution. The last session discussed marital rehabilitation programs and their impact on family cohesion.\nConcluding with practical recommendations, the seminar aimed to serve as an interactive platform that brought experts, researchers, and civil society institutions together to broaden thought horizons and to examine pressing contemporary issues related to family policies and sustainable development.\nDIFI is a global policy and advocacy institute working to advance knowledge on Arab families through research and promote evidence-based polices at a national, regional, and international level.
