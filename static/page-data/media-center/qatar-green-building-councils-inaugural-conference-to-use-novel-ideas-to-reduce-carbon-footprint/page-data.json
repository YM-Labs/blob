QGBC will demonstrate its commitment to sustainability by measuring and reducing the carbon footprint of the Conference itself, bridging the gap between rhetoric and practice.<br>\n <img width=\"640\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QGBC_Cobranded%20Logo_BILINGUAL_80-20_PANTONE-17.jpg\" alt=\"QGBC_Cobranded Logo_BILINGUAL_80-20_PANTONE.jpg\"><br>\n Ms Jane Anderson, QGBC&#x2019;s lead carbon foot printing specialist and Principal Consultant at Thinkstep, a worldwide leading environmental consultancy group with subsidiaries across four continents, will be measuring the conference&#x2019;s carbon footprint using a variety of techniques and processes.Thinkstep, previously known as PE International, is one of the largest and most respected sustainable consultancies in the world through its work advising organizations and governments. <br>\n <br>\n The carbon footprinting techniques that will be applied include measuring the operational energy consumed per square meter of conference area, the consumption of food and beverages, as well as the distance traveled by participants and their mode of transportation among other activities.<br>\n <br>\n The findings of the carbon footprint study will feature in a comprehensive sustainability report to be released after the conference that hopefully will inspire other event organizers, businesses, companies and institutions in Qatar and the region to follow suit. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/19_04_15_QGBC%20Conference%20Sustainability%20_En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf83","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-green-building-councils-inaugural-conference-to-use-novel-ideas-to-reduce-carbon-footprint","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-green-building-councils-inaugural-conference-to-use-novel-ideas-to-reduce-carbon-footprint","title":"Qatar Green Building Council’s Inaugural Conference to Use Novel Ideas to Reduce Carbon Footprint"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
