This is the reason why every member of the community should do their best to look after their health and to prevent the onset of any diseases. It has become increasingly important to prevent chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we should encourage innovation in healthcare, since this is extremely important to all the Arab countries.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr Bekkali added, &#x201C;We hope that this visit will be fruitful and provide us with an opportunity to foster several collaborations in the field of medical research with Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s scientific and research centres, among them Sidra Medical and Research Center, with which we have established good relations.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Sidra Medical and Research Center, a member of Qatar Foundation, is a groundbreaking hospital, research and educational institution, which is setting new standards in patient care for women and children in Qatar, the Gulf region and internationally.
