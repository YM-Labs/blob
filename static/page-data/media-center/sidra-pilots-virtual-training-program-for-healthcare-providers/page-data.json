The program was developed in partnership with the Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) to advance medical education opportunities as well as collaborative efforts between different healthcare providers. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Sidra-Logo-RGB-L-9-17.jpg\" alt=\"Sidra-Logo-RGB-L-9.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"426\"><br>\n This is the first time that the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners (QCHP) has accredited healthcare inter-provider virtual training in the country. The program is also in alignment with the Qatar National Vision 2030 to provide efficient public services and integrated health care in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n The first pilot session was delivered to PHCC in late May with live broadcasting reaching four PHCC sites simultaneously across Doha, Al Khor, and Duhail regions. The session was led by Dr. Jai P. Udassi, the Acting Division Chief of Critical Care Medicine and Director of Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care at Sidra. Dr. Udassi is also an Associate Professor of the Department of Pediatrics at Weill-Cornell Medical College in Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n The highly interactive session focused on distinguishing between pediatric heart sounds and murmurs that can be treated under primary care and those that can be referred to specialist care. This is to help primary care doctors &#x2013; who are most often the first point of contact for patients - to differentiate between cases that can be handled at their clinics and those that will need to be referred to specialists at Sidra. This distinction is important for increasing community-based care, as it enhances patient convenience and resource efficiency.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The pathway to a nationally integrated clinical network depends on collaboration. Sidra is pleased to partner with PHCC and QCHP to play a role in enhancing community-based care - one of the objectives of the National Primary Care Strategy 2013-2018. Two way dialogue is very important between the primary care provider and the specialist, in order to understand patient needs and provide safe care in a timely manner. I strongly believe that all healthcare providers in Qatar have to work as a team in order to provide best evidence based care. In addition it is important to know what community resources are available across the network to ensure routine health checks, follow up and continuity of care,&#x201D; said Dr. Udassi.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/2017_06_20%20-%20Sidra%20Hosts%20Virtual%20Training%20with%20PHCC%20%20-%20ENG.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf74","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-pilots-virtual-training-program-for-healthcare-providers","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-pilots-virtual-training-program-for-healthcare-providers","title":"Sidra Pilots Virtual Training Program for Healthcare Providers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
