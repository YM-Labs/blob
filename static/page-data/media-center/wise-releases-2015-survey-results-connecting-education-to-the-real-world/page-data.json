But only 39 per cent believe universities in their countries are adequately preparing students for the workplace.<br>\n <br>\n The WISE survey was conducted by Gallup, an American research-based, global performance-management consulting company. The respondents included teachers, students, recent graduates, education policy makers, and members of the private sector who are connected with WISE on education reform issues. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/02%2011%202015_WISE%20PR%20Survey_EN_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">click here.</a></strong>&#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf71","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-releases-2015-survey-results-connecting-education-to-the-real-world","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-releases-2015-survey-results-connecting-education-to-the-real-world","title":"WISE Releases 2015 Survey Results: Connecting Education to the Real World"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
