Experts will discuss their latest research in fields as diverse as data mining, signal processing, human-centric machine learning, acoustics and facial recognition technology. <br>\n <br>\n The speakers will include Stanford University&#x2019;s Prof. Benjamin Van Roy, who will speak on the benefits of gathering &#x201C;smart data&#x201D; rather than relying on passively accumulating &#x201C;big data&#x201D;. Georgia Institute of Technology&#x2019;s Prof. Branislav Vidakovic, a pioneer in the use of wavelets for signal processing, will discuss his latest work on wavelet-based scaling indices for machine learning. Dr. Seema Chopra, a Technical Lead at Boeing Research and Technology, will explore refining frameworks that enable humans to interact with machine learning models. And QCRI&#x2019;s Jisun An will discuss her work on some of the opportunities and limitations of facial detection technology.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Machine learning is the fastest growing field in engineering and science, because it is used in every field. Therefore, it is no surprise that this event transformed from a small 30-person event in 2014 to the largest machine learning and data analytics forum in the Middle East. We hope that creating an opportunity for the free exchange of ideas, such as MLDAS, will inspire innovation, improve industry and the community as a whole.&#x201D; said Bernard Dunn, president of Boeing Middle East, North Africa and Turkey.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Ahmed Elmagarmid, Executive Director, QCRI, described the symposium as an extension of a partnership in research and application, including a collaboration to jointly develop predictive aircraft maintenance technology, between QCRI and Boeing.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We have enjoyed building a dynamic partnership with Boeing since 2013, and this annual event with experts presenting the latest research in machine learning and data analytics builds on that,&#x201D; Dr Elmagarmid said.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We are grateful to Boeing for their continued support of world-class computing in Qatar.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The MLDAS symposium is open to students, researchers and industry experts from around the world.
