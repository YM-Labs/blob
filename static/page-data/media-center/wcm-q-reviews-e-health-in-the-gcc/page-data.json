The results were then published by the Royal Society of Medicine&#x2019;s Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare, the number one ranked publication in its field.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Alan S. Weber, Visiting Associate Professor of English at WCM-Q, led the research team, which comprised students Rebal Turjoman, Mu Ji Hwang, Faryal Malick, Farah Al Sayyed and Yanal Shaheen. Qatar&#x2019;s leading role in developing new data privacy laws and secure networks was an important finding of the study. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Researchers at ICTQatar, Qatar University and Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar know that medical privacy and confidentiality are key patient concerns in the Muslim world,&#x201D; Dr. Weber said. &#x201C;Also, although a cybercriminal is probably not interested in intercepting the medical information of the average person on the Internet, the medical records of VIPs or the famous are highly sensitive information.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Weber said: &#x201C;E-health services are the future as more people use internet-enabled devices. Can be used to monitor health at home with remote sensors, send SMS health alerts when to take medicines, and even face-to-face meetings with doctors via chat software when patients have difficulty making it to the hospital or when they need to consult a highly specialized doctor in another country.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/161116%20English%20WCM-Q%20team%20publishes%20first%20comprehensive%20review%20of%20e-health%20in%20the%20GCC.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf31","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-reviews-e-health-in-the-gcc","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-reviews-e-health-in-the-gcc","title":"WCM-Q Reviews E-Health in the GCC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
