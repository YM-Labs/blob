The event was one of several that the university has been holding in its 20th year, which opened in 1998 and was originally called Shaqab College of Design Arts. The first degree programs in Fashion Design, and Graphic Design in 1999, followed the establishment of its Art Foundation program in 1998. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/VCUartsQatar%2020th%20Students%20cake-24.jpg\" alt=\"VCUartsQatar 20th Students cake.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Students, faculty and staff gathered in the Atrium to take part in Virginia Commonwealth University-themed board games and other games and activities including having their photographs taken at a 20th anniversary photo booth, and to enjoy the chocolate fountain, nachos, crazy drinks, and other fun snacks. <br>\n <br>\n The event began with an introduction by Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Valerie Jeremijenko, who said: &#x201C;As someone who has been here for close to 17 of those 20 years, I have been witness to the work of all the faculty, all the staff, and all our amazing students and alumni, as we have worked towards cultivating the arts, igniting imaginations and changing the perception of art and design in Qatar.
