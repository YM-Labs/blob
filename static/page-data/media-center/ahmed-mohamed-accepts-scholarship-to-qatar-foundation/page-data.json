Palestinian Iqbal Al Assaad became the youngest ever medical graduate from Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar in 2013, and Sudanese Mursi Khalid Mursi Saleh began studying at Qatar Academy in 2006 and is the first child from the Middle East to become a member of Mensa &#x2013; the most prestigious IQ society in the world. Another young innovator is Raji Al Hammori who studied at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar and is currently pursuing graduate studies at MIT.<br>\n <br>\n After accepting Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s scholarship, Ahmed said, &#x201C;I was really impressed with everything that Qatar Foundation has to offer and the campuses are really cool. I got to meet other kids who are also really interested in science and technology. I think I will learn a lot and also have lots of fun there.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n As an incubator of knowledge and talent, QF values its multiculturalism, diversity and non-discriminatory atmosphere, and is happy to welcome Ahmed to the Young Innovators Program. QF isglad to welcome the family to Doha and provide Ahmed with the opportunity to develop his skills and excel in future endeavors. &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf69","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/ahmed-mohamed-accepts-scholarship-to-qatar-foundation","currSlug":"/media-center/ahmed-mohamed-accepts-scholarship-to-qatar-foundation","title":"Ahmed Mohamed Accepts Scholarship to Qatar Foundation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
