In less than eight months of construction, the Passivhaus villa achieved this target. With just a 16 percent increase in capital costs, it is predicted to consume 50 percent less water and energy, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by half. <br>\n <br>\n The main causes for uplift in construction costs were increased thickness of insulation, triple glazing of window and door systems, high-efficiency lighting and advanced light control systems, as well as sun shading devices in the atrium.<br>\n <br>\n These measures also led to cost saving from the reduction in size of the air-conditioning mechanical equipment required, due to the reduced cooling loads, which are roughly one third that of the conventional villa.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Amato believes that there is potential to further reduce the capital costs of adopting Passivhaus standards for Qatar&#x2019;s climate if &#x2018;lean construction&#x2019; techniques are applied, such as prefabrication and off-site manufacturing, together with sustainable procurement supply chain opportunities. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2qf39","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/boost-to-green-living-as-new-figures-for-passivhaus-add-up","currSlug":"/media-center/boost-to-green-living-as-new-figures-for-passivhaus-add-up","title":"Boost to Green Living as New Figures For Passivhaus Add Up"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
