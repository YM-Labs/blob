In one film, students Rawan Al-Thabatah, Hazar Eskandar and Malak Monir asked a leading editorial figure at the <em>NYT</em> how top media organizations in New York portray conflicts in the Middle East to the rest of the world.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;By our very nature we tend to look at what&#x2019;s going wrong as opposed to what&#x2019;s going right, and that includes [stories about] our own countries,&#x201D; Larry Ingrassia, the <em>New York Times</em> assistant managing editor for new initiatives, told the student filmmakers. &#x201C;Other publications tend to be more simplistic.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Ingrassia also spoke about the different ways New York outlets are reaching their audiences. &#x201C;We are platform agnostic; we don&#x2019;t care how you get your news, we want to be a source of news for you. Increasingly people are getting news on mobile apps. We are developing a lower price app called Need to Know that shows the top ten-15 stories in the <em>NYT</em> every day.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n In contrast to the relative chaos of New York, the students met with key figures at Dubai Media City to discuss the benefits of a centrally-planned and subsidized media &#x201C;free zone,&#x201D; and considered the career prospects at one of the region&#x2019;s largest media hubs. In a visit to Dubai Studio City, they observed another unique operation to the region: an organization that censors and edits content for a Saudi Arabian outlet.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Northwestern &#x2019;s website, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://qatar-news.northwestern.edu/global-media/\">click here</a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf41","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/students-report-back-from-global-media-experience","currSlug":"/media-center/students-report-back-from-global-media-experience","title":"Students Report Back From Global Media Experience"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
