But the 2014 Russian invasion of the Crimea dashed Tatars&#x2019; hopes of reclaiming their homeland and added another, more immediate chapter to the story and is at the heart of Paschyn&#x2019;s film.<br>\n <br>\n It&#x2019;s a topic near to the heart of Paschyn, a Ukrainian. Paschyn spent a month in Crimea in 2012 shooting footage for the film, and interviewed a wide range of subjects, from a Tatar woman who&#x2019;d been forcibly displaced in the 1940s to the dissident Tatar leader Mustafa Dzhemilev. <br>\n <br>\n A Struggle for Home also features interviews with Sergey Aksyonov, who in 2012 was a low-level politician in the Russian Unity party. After the Russian invasion and subsequent annexation of Crimea, however, he became Prime Minister of the region. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/AlJazeera%20Film%20Festival.pdf\">click here.</a></strong> &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf23","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-faculty-documentary-screened-at-al-jazeera-international-film-festival","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-faculty-documentary-screened-at-al-jazeera-international-film-festival","title":"NU-Q Faculty Documentary Screened at Al Jazeera International Film Festival"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
