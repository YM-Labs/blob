He recalled &#x200E;that &#x201C;by the first half of 2003, the SARS coronavirus had spread to 29 nations on five &#x200E;continents,&#x201D; largely through air travel. <br>\n <br>\n The virus initially spread through hospitals as infected &#x200E;patients transmitted the disease to medical staff who in turn infected family members. The &#x200E;contagion had a 10 percent fatality rate; out of the approximately 8,000 people who were &#x200E;diagnosed, 800 people died. <br>\n <br>\n Due to the large percentage of fatalities, the Chinese government &#x200E;received heavy criticism for their handling of the situation, but, according to Lucey, because this &#x200E;was such a novel disease that spread at such a rapid pace, it could not have been predicted, nor &#x200E;easily halted. &#x200E;<br>\n <br>\n In the Middle East, a novel coronavirus appeared in Jordan in 2012 and spread to medical staff &#x200E;at a hospital and some of their family members in much the same pattern as the SARS and H1N1 &#x200E;viruses were transmitted. It was first identified, however, in a patient in Saudi Arabia. The virus &#x200E;was then also reported to have infected patients in Qatar and the UAE. <br>\n <br>\n Lucey maintained that &#x200E;&#x200E;&#x201C;by genetic sequencing, it is very similar to the coronaviruses that are known to exist in bats,&#x201D; but &#x200E;this connection remains unconfirmed. <br>\n <br>\n In conclusion, Lucey argued that because &#x201C;there is no antiviral drug treatment either then or &#x200E;today, neither for the SARS coronavirus, nor the new virus discovered in the Middle East last &#x200E;year,&#x201D; it is important to be vigilant about preventing the spread of the disease. There are two main &#x200E;lessons that can be learned from the 2002-2003 SARS coronavirus epidemic that can be adapted &#x200E;to mitigate the 2012-2013 new coronavirus in the Middle East. <br>\n <br>\n The first is that &#x201C;hospital &#x200E;outbreaks are early warnings&#x201D; that indicate the rise of a contagious virus, especially if medical &#x200E;workers infect family members outside of the medical facility. The second is the international &#x200E;spread of a virus due to air travel and contact of an infected person with others in different &#x200E;countries. Lucey argued that &#x201C;as new virus epidemics occur, they have to start somewhere, and &#x200E;the sooner we can recognize them at the start, the more likely we can stop them, or at least &#x200E;mitigate their serious effects &#x2013; serious in terms of public health, and serious in terms of economic &#x200E;impact.&#x201D;&#x200E;<br>\n <br>\n <strong>Article by Suzi Mirgani, Manager and Editor for CIRS Publications.<br>\n </strong><br>\n To read the full story and watch the lecture video, please visit this link: <a href=\"http://cirs.georgetown.edu/377251.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://cirs.georgetown.edu/377251.html</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf39","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/daniel-lucey-on-global-viral-outbreaks","currSlug":"/media-center/daniel-lucey-on-global-viral-outbreaks","title":"Daniel Lucey On Global Viral Outbreaks"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
