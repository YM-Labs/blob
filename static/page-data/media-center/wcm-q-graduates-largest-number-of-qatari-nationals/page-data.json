The new physicians mean that WCM-Q, under the patronage of Qatar Foundation, has now graduated a total of 335 doctors since the Class of 2008 received their Cornell MD degrees. With 13 Qatari citizens, the Class of 2018 contains the greatest number of nationals to graduate in one year.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Javaid Sheikh, Dean of WCM-Q, paid tribute to the hard work, dedication and compassion of the new doctors. He said: &#x201C;Graduation is the highlight of the academic year; it is the culmination of everything that we strive for. The Class of 2018 have demonstrated great commitment to their studies, intellectual curiosity and compassion for their patients. These qualities will continue to grow and develop as they progress through their careers and care for their patients in Qatar&#x2019;s hospitals and the wider world.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;This year is also particularly significant because of the number of Qatari nationals who are graduating today. More than a third of the Class of 2018 are national citizens and this is testament to the vision of Qatar&#x2019;s leadership of creating a knowledge economy and a hub of biomedical excellence within the region. Qatar Foundation, under the eminent guidance of HH the Emir, HH the Father Emir, HH Sheikha Moza, and HE Sheikha Hind, is developing national human capacity and creating a sustainable society for generations to come.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The 34 new doctors will now join the ranks of their fellow alumni, who are working at Hamad Medical Corporation and other leading hospitals throughout the world.<br>\n <br>\n In her speech to the audience, class speaker Fatima Al-Maadid told her classmates: &#x201C;This privilege that we have of education, trust and insight into people and their stories makes us the voice of the vulnerable, whatever voice that may be. In a world that oppresses this truth and tries to forget humanity, in a world where cynicism eclipses idealism, your voice is to personify people and the word of possibilities.
