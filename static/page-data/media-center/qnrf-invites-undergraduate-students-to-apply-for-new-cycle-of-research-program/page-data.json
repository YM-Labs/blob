UREP has also witnessed high levels of participation by Qatari females, with over 500 young women applying for grants. <br>\n <br>\n Previous UREP projects have focused on a wide range of topics such as the treatment of wastewater produced by Qatar&#x2019;s oil and gas industry, electricity consumption in residential and industrial sectors in Qatar, methods for screening gastrointestinal pathogens amongst expatriates working in Qatar and the nature and extent of emotional and behavioral disorders present amongst students in Qatar&#x2019;s independent schools.<br>\n <br>\n Registration for participation in the 15th cycle of UREP opens on the 25 September 2013.
