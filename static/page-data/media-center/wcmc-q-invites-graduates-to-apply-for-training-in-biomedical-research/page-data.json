The initiative is a unique opportunity for Qatari college graduates with an interest in biomedical research to gain hands on experience in world-class laboratories at WCM-Q and in the different administrative and managerial responsibilities related to biomedical research. <br>\n <br>\n Although the program is aimed at recent graduates who are interested in pursuing a career as a bench or clinical researcher, or a research administrator, applications from nationals are welcomed irrespective of their discipline. The training program is a full-time, six-month employment commitment with trainees receiving a graduation certificate upon completion.<br>\n <br>\n The trainees are paid a stipend as part of a comprehensive compensation package. The program is fully funded by WCM-Q, and is organized in partnership with the Qatar Science Leadership Program at Qatar Foundation.<br>\n <br>\n The program was launched in 2011 and has so far provided training to 28 interns. It was inspired by Qatar National Vision 2030 and the goal of creating a knowledge-based economy by helping build the national human capacity and training Qataris for a post-hydrocarbon future. Applications can be submitted online until November 6.</div>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160904%20English%20WCMC-Q%20invites%20graduates%20to%20apply%20for%20training%20in%20biomedical%20research.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a><br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf73","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcmc-q-invites-graduates-to-apply-for-training-in-biomedical-research","currSlug":"/media-center/wcmc-q-invites-graduates-to-apply-for-training-in-biomedical-research","title":"WCMC-Q Invites Graduates To Apply For Training In Biomedical Research"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
