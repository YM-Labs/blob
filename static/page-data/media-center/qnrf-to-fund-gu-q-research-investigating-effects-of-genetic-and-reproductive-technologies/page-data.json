More particularly, the research study will look at how these technologies raise questions about traditional definitions of both paternity and maternity and the extent to which these two concepts should remain tied to marriage.<br>\n <img width=\"568\" height=\"426\" alt=\"Georgetown University\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/RERESIZED%20Georgetown%20University-17.jpg\"><br>\n This project is another addition to the larger Islamic Bioethics Project which started in 2009 with a three-year QNRF-funded project by GU-Q in cooperation with the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University - main campus in Washington DC to develop an information resource for Islamic Medical and Scientific Ethics (IMSE). <br>\n <br>\n The IMSE project aimed to identify, collect, catalog, and index relevant multilingual and multi-format resources and facilitate access to these resources by creating comprehensive bibliographic records within an integrated information retrieval system. Following the success of this first project, in 2012 another three-year project to develop an Encyclopedia of Islamic Bioethics was proposed and granted funding also from QNRF.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QNRFtofundGU-QresearchoneffectsofgeneticandreproductivetechnologiesinIslamicfamilylaw.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf45","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qnrf-to-fund-gu-q-research-investigating-effects-of-genetic-and-reproductive-technologies","currSlug":"/media-center/qnrf-to-fund-gu-q-research-investigating-effects-of-genetic-and-reproductive-technologies","title":"QNRF to fund GU-Q Research Investigating Effects of Genetic and Reproductive Technologies"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
