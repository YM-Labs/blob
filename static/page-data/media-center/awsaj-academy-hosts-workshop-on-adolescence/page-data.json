The training was prepared and presented by Dr Batoul Khalifa, Associate Professor at QU&apos;s College of Education. <br>\n <br>\n Participants at the workshop first learned what the stages of adolescence are, as well as some of the specific challenges that accompany each stage such as daydreaming, aggression, and misbehavior. Dr Khalifa identified several unhelpful but common parenting practices to avoid. She addressed the question of whether negative consequences are appropriate for use with teenagers, as well as how to use positive reinforcement. She also taught strategies for helping adolescents manage their anger. Finally, she described a parenting skills program that teaches parents how to help their children develop self-help skills and positive behavior.<br>\n <br>\n A series of workshops is running every month at Awsaj Academy in order to help parents increase their knowledge and understanding of their children&#x2019;s special educational needs.
