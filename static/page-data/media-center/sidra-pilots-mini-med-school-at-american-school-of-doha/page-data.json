The eight week interactive program was developed to stoke the interests of senior students in health science careers, and to relate their science studies to the world of medicine.<br>\n <img width=\"700\" height=\"350\" alt=\"Sidra-doctors-from-Mini-Med-School.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Sidra-doctors-from-Mini-Med-School.jpg\"><br>\n The Mini Med School featured a series of presentations from Sidra doctors, including such topics as postmortem examinations; the most common and the most terrifying infectious diseases and how the body uses oxygen. Students also learnt how medication can paralyze people for surgery; how changing technologies can look inside the human body; and how deformities can be cured.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Jason Ford, Division Chief of Hematopathology at Sidra, developed and launched the program at ASD. Dr Ford stated, &#x201C;Medical Education is a key mission at Sidra, and we are continually working towards providing valuable opportunities for learning. The Mini Med School is an excellent opportunity to showcase the wonders of medicine and medical learning to a younger audience. One of the primary objectives was to make the sessions as fun and interactive as possible. Given that it was a voluntary after-school activity, we really wanted to make sure the students felt that there was value in attending the sessions. We were overwhelmed with the response &#x2013; each session ran at full classroom capacity.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The program sessions were tailored to give the students an opportunity to try various medical techniques. Most of the doctors brought in Sidra&#x2019;s Simulation team to help showcase certain medical procedures on manikins &#x2013; offering students the opportunity for more hands-on experience. Over 100 different students participated in the Mini Med School, with most attending all eight sessions. A second Mini Med School at ASD is being planned for 2016.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Sidra&#x2019;s website, please <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sidra.org/sidra-pilots-mini-med-school-at-american-school-of-doha/\">click here.</a></strong>&#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf73","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-pilots-mini-med-school-at-american-school-of-doha","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-pilots-mini-med-school-at-american-school-of-doha","title":"Sidra Pilots Mini Med School at American School of Doha"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
