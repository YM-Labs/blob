The initiative particularly focuses on the needs of children, women and the youth affected by poverty, conflict and disaster, and aims to empower them to become active community members. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;My role on the team was to represent Qatari youth and indicate their active involvement through our training and projects in the field of access to education,&#x201D; said Al-Anzy of her participation in the recent UN meeting. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Education alone is not enough. For it to be effective, it needs to sit alongside economic empowerment, leadership skills and psychosocial support. This is a model unique to EAA that is not just about supporting individuals to improve their lives, but building the skills of whole communities to build a better future. My aim was to relay these messages continuously on a platform where political leaders and influencers existed to insist for change and action. A shift in ideas is the first step towards creating change - and what better way to shift the narrative on youth and education than by hearing from youth and a student herself?&#x201D;.<br>\n <br>\n Al-Anzy has been part of the EAA youth advocacy program since her first year at GU-Q, which has enabled her to benefit from training in leadership skills, vocational skills, cultural sensitivity, project management and facilitation, to support her work with the organization. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Georgetown%20student%20at%20UN%20-%20Release%20-%20English.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf88","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/georgetown-student-advocates-for-access-to-education-at-un","currSlug":"/media-center/georgetown-student-advocates-for-access-to-education-at-un","title":"Georgetown Student Advocates for Access to Education at UN"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
