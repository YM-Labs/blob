The children will learn design, coding and how to develop engineering solutions over five daily three-hour sessions beginning on Sunday, July 16 and Sunday, July 23.Dr Fituri said the second week&#x2019;s activities would be different from the first for students wanting to register for both weeks of the computing camp.<br>\n <br>\n Participants in the two-week Arduino Teen Camp will learn how to create electronic gadgets that can interact with the real world, in three-hour daily sessions during the fortnight-long course between July 16 and 27.<br>\n <br>\n QCRI successfully launched its Creative Space at an open house event in May. About 100 children from kindergarten age to Grade 12 were registered for the event within a day of it being announced &#x2013; and they didn&#x2019;t want to leave.<br>\n To learn more about HBKU, or register to attend any of the upcoming events, visit hbku.edu.qa. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170712%20Qatar%20Computing%20Research%20Institute%20to%20conduct%20first%20summer%20computing%20camps%20for%20kids%20EN%20FINAL.pdf\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf77","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qcri-to-conduct-first-summer-computing-camps-for-kids","currSlug":"/media-center/qcri-to-conduct-first-summer-computing-camps-for-kids","title":"QCRIto conduct first summer computing camps for kids"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
