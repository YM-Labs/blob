This pioneering research, sponsored by Qatar Foundation, gives us a unique insight into what it is about their about the healthcare systems in these countries that enables them to successfully &#x2018;diffuse&#x2019; innovation, with the aim of inspiring other countries around the world to adopt the best methods and ideas.&#x201C;<br>\n <br>\n The Innovation Plenary Panel discussed exciting new developments in technology, management and medical practice in the context of global healthcare demands. These included an ambulance redesign from the UK, a water purifier from Sweden, and a handheld visualization tool powered by ultrasound technology that enables inspection inside the patient during a physical exam.<br>\n <br>\n Engineer Saad Al Muhannadi, President of Qatar Foundation said:&#x201C;Fostering healthcare innovation in Qatar and abroad is an integral part of Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s ambition to become a global center of excellence in medical practice, education, and research.WISH has provided a platform for this, giving countries from around the world a unique opportunity to share information and learn from each other&#x2019;s success. We want to build on this in future years, working together to discover new approaches to global public health challenges and improve the lives of millions of people around the world.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/WISH%20final%20press%20release%20(English).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf34","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/countries-struggle-to-spread-new-ideas-in-healthcare","currSlug":"/media-center/countries-struggle-to-spread-new-ideas-in-healthcare","title":"Countries Struggle To Spread New Ideas In Healthcare"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
