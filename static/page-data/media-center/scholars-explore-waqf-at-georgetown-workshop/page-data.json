Discussions focused on the social aspects and value of the endowments and also explored its transformations, influenced by power relations that come into play when the concept is formally managed or regulated by different governments. <br>\n <br>\n The participants explored the different forms of charitable donations in different cultures, and also the linguistic aspects of the term &#x2018;waqf&#x2019;. GU-Q Professor Yehia A. Mohamed gave a presentation on the linguistic aspects of waqf. It was noted that donations seemed to vary in different cultures during different periods of time. <br>\n <br>\n Scholars from universities in Qatar, Turkey, Italy, Jordan, Egypt and Japan participated in the workshop and discussed different projects that provided an in-depth research on the same topic.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20qf91","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/scholars-explore-waqf-at-georgetown-workshop","currSlug":"/media-center/scholars-explore-waqf-at-georgetown-workshop","title":"Scholars Explore ‘Waqf’ at Georgetown Workshop"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
