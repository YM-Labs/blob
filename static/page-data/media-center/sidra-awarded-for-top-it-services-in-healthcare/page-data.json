This allows physicians to directly enter patient data including medication orders. The CPOE has been proven to drastically reduce errors in areas such as medication administration and dosage, illegible handwriting and patient allergy alerts. Another safety feature is the five rights of &#x201C;closed loop&#x201D; medication administration &#x2013; where patient records and medications both have bar codes to ensure that the right dose is administered to the right patient at the right time. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/2017_02_25%20-%20Sidra%20OPC%20achieves%20HIMSS%206%20-%20ENG-.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf24","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-awarded-for-top-it-services-in-healthcare","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-awarded-for-top-it-services-in-healthcare","title":"Sidra Awarded for Top IT Services in Healthcare"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
