DCD is the kickoff event in a series of upcoming events planned for counselors and other school administrators this academic year. The HBKU Student Affairs team will also design and deliver several workshops and programs aimed for schools administrators, counselors and principals. <br>\n <br>\n The goal of these workshops is to provide counselors with information about HBKU partner universities in addition to tools to help them better advise students applying to these universities. The workshops will start this fall, and will run throughout the academic year, each focusing on a different topic and areas where students face challenges.<br>\n <br>\n Counselors attending this year&#x2019;s event also witnessed the launch of HBKU&#x2019;s most recent publication &apos;<em>Preparing Students for University: A Counselors Guide to Assist Students</em>&apos;. <br>\n <br>\n The publication provides school counselors with essential information about the university admissions process for HBKU partner universities, and covers a range of topics such as testing, early college awareness, career advising, and detailed timelines that will provide counselors with a comprehensive sense of the process for guiding students and parents. <br>\n <br>\n As part of the day&#x2019;s program, the HBKU Student Affairs team also hosted a workshop to provide counselors with deeper understanding as to how this publication will help them in their work with students and their families.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/131009%20DCD%20Release_FINAL_ENG.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf7","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hamad-bin-khalifa-university-launches-counselors-guidebook-at-doha-counselors-day","currSlug":"/media-center/hamad-bin-khalifa-university-launches-counselors-guidebook-at-doha-counselors-day","title":"Hamad bin Khalifa University Launches Counselors Guidebook at Doha Counselors Day"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
