NU-Q&#x2019;s faculty works with their students on research projects in science and technology, media and news consumption, health communication, digital literacy, museum studies, and more.<br>\n &#x201C;Research is a core element of an NU-Q student&#x2019;s academic experience,&#x201D; said Everette E. Dennis, dean and CEO. &#x201C;Our home campus in Evanston is one of the leading research universities in the world, and NU-Q is committed to continuing that tradition through scholarly studies that address important issues in the region.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Student Research Week at NU-Q includes a community meeting, hosted by student researchers who discuss their experiences working on different research projects. <br>\n <br>\n Sarah Al-Ansari works with Professor Anto Mohsin on a research project funded by the Qatar National Research Fund through the Undergraduate Research Experience Program (UREP), which is exploring the engagement and understanding of science in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Research opened new doors of opportunity for me to develop personally and professionally,&#x201D; said Al-Ansari. &#x201C;I was able to learn and hone new academic skills and will soon have the chance to present my work at international conferences, where I can network and discuss my project with leaders in the science research field.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Students at NU-Q also receive grants for independent research projects from Northwestern&#x2019;s Office of Undergraduate Research. Zaki Hussain, Neha Rashid, and Ammar Younas received a Summer Undergraduate Research Grant from Northwestern to investigate bonded labor in Pakistan. As a result of the research, they created a short documentary and a feature article on the topic.<br>\n <br>\n Throughout Research Week, NU-Q students meet with staff from the research office to learn more about grants and projects they can apply for. Professors take time throughout the week to discuss their research with students and to present opportunities for students to contribute.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Research-20Week-20Sept-202017-20-20English-20(Final)(2).pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf58","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-students-engage-in-research","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-students-engage-in-research","title":"NU-Q Students Engage in Research"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
