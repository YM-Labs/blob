Torba Farmers Market, which will offer an array of artisan, organic, and locally-grown food and products, will serve as this platform. And Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s Education City is the perfect location.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Torba Farmers Market is a community-inspired initiative that is aimed at promoting organic, homegrown produce in a bid to create healthier, more active communities.
