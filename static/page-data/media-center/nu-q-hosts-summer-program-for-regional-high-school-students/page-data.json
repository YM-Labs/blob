This introduction to an education in media allowed them to discover the process of story structure and news creation, as well as to deconstruct larger concepts such as media bias and differentiate fact and opinion.<br>\n <br>\n NU-Q Professor Miriam Berg, who taught the summer course, noted that students enrolled in the program &#x201C;gain the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and create media and understand how to be critical thinkers.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The students worked in teams to write short features and shoot videos, which they presented at the end of the program. &#x201C;The program has encouraged me to be more curious and to talk to people. The most challenging &#x2013; and interesting &#x2013; part has been finding stories that are newsworthy and compelling,&#x201D; said M.E.S Indian School senior Ashraf Haque. <br>\n <br>\n Two NU-Q alumni, Aamer Hassan and Ruba Shaath, assisted Berg with the program, which Hassan participated in as a high school student. &#x201C;I first came to NU-Q as a student in one of these summer programs. It really helped me become clear about the career I wanted, and what I wanted to pursue in college,&#x201D; he said.<br>\n <br>\n This year&#x2019;s students may end up following in Hassan&#x2019;s footsteps. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m here to understand what it takes to be a Northwestern student&#x2026; and what it takes to be a journalist,&#x201D; said Fatma Al-Mohannadi, a student at Al Khor Secondary School.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf36","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-hosts-summer-program-for-regional-high-school-students","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-hosts-summer-program-for-regional-high-school-students","title":"NU-Q Hosts Summer Program for Regional High School Students"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
