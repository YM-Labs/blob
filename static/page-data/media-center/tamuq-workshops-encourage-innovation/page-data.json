Students developed novel solutions to energy and health care challenges, and then they built prototypes to demonstrate their inventions. The program was designed to motivate students in science and engineering while teaching skills essential to becoming leaders in engineering and innovation.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Qatar%20Invents_250117_ALX_5520-17.jpg\" alt=\"Qatar Invents_250117_ALX_5520.jpg\" width=\"639\" height=\"426\"><br>\n In App Camp, students worked in teams to design and develop an iOS app. They learned how to code, prototype, test and refine their ideas along the way. Apps developed by the students included a fitness app; a digital personal trainer linked into Qatar&#x2019;s fitness sector, including gyms and nutrition specialists; a fashion design app featuring a digital tailor that helps create clothing that not available in stores; a trivia game about Qatar and its traditions; and a cultural app with information for tourists about Qatar&#x2019;s culture and attractions, language and more.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Qatar%20Invents_250117_ALX_5543-17.jpg\" alt=\"Qatar Invents_250117_ALX_5543.jpg\" width=\"639\" height=\"426\"><br>\n Qatar Invents and App Camp are part of the Dhia: Engineering Leaders initiative, a partnership between Texas A&amp;M at Qatar and Maersk Oil Qatar.
