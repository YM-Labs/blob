The new program of study is the result of four years of painstaking review and consultation, which began at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York and was later applied in Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n The new curriculum broadly follows that of WCM-Q&#x2019;s home campus in New York, with certain adaptations to fit local circumstances and maximize the benefits of WCM-Q&#x2019;s particular strengths, such as its highly favorable student to faculty ratio, well-developed biomedical research program and support from Qatar Foundation. The new four-year medical curriculum is designed to follow on from the two-year WCM-Q pre-medical curriculum; together, the two curricula form the cohesive and comprehensive WCM-Q Six-Year Medical Program. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170130%20English%20WCMQ.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf8","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-introduces-changes-to-curriculum","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-introduces-changes-to-curriculum","title":"WCM-Q Introduces Changes to Curriculum"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
