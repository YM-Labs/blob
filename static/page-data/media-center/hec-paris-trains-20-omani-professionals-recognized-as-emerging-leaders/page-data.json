While we have a strong focus on leadership, participants also had the chance to strengthen and expand their skills in areas such as strategy, change management, and finance. I look forward to learning how the participants use the frameworks and skills and thereby have an impact at the individual, team, and organizational level. I am confident that they will make important contributions.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The Emerging Leaders program comes at a time when more than ever do we recognize a need to provide high-quality educational and developmental opportunities to Oman&#x2019;s professionals&#x201D;, said Hilal Al Jadidi, Director of Consulting Services at Takatuf. &#x201C;Future leaders in the public and private sectors need access to formative experiences to help them realize their full potential and to reach the management roles they aspire to.
