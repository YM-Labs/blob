Dennis, dean and CEO, said, &#x201C;is an instrumental part of our journalism and strategic communication program. It also distinguishes NU-Q as the only media school in the region with an embedded program for students to experience working at top media operations around the world. Our students&#x2019; experience is heightened during their residences &#x2013; developing new skills, testing recently-learned skills, working under deadline, and building confidence in their capabilities as professional communicators.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the first time, NU-Q will place a student &#x2013; Shageaa Naqvi &#x2013; at The Washington Post where she will focus on science and health reporting. &#x201C;I will learn how the newsroom works in the real world, learn to refine and pitch story ideas as well as be able to work with the best science reporters in the field. This sort of experience will help me become a better reporter and will prepare me to begin working for a news organization after I graduate,&#x201D; said Naqvi. <br>\n <br>\n The residency program has been recognized as an important learning component allowing students to network with professionals in the field, explore career paths, and implement theories and ideas discussed in the classroom to the real world. Media residencies have been a part of Northwestern&#x2019;s Medill School for more than 40 years, a practice that NU-Q has continued with its program in Doha.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/JR%20Residencies%20_Advance_2017_Final%5B2%5D.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf71","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-students-start-internship-at-major-media-firms","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-students-start-internship-at-major-media-firms","title":"NU-Q Students Start Internship at Major Media Firms"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
