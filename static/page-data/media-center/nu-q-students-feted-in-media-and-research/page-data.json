Dennis, dean and CEO.<br>\n <br>\n Prior to the awards ceremony, the university hosted a showcase of all nominees at the HBKU Student Center in Education City. All of the submissions were adjudicated by local and international industry leaders &#x2013; many of whom were present at both events to recognize the efforts of the nominees.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Winners%20of%20Best%20Fiction%20Film%20-%20Hissa%20Al%20Mannai,%20Sulaima%20AlHaj%20Abed-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n &#x201C;I&#x2019;m glad that people are passionate about telling these stories, making sure that we know about these issues. What is important is that the students keep on doing it and that they remember it&#x2019;s all about the people,&#x201D; said Kamahl Santamaria, a journalist at Al Jazeera English. &#x201C;I think people have the right idea. The energy, passion, and support that the students have for each other are wonderful to see. It heartens me that there are that many young people who want to do this still.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We&apos;re incredibly proud of our work and we&apos;re overwhelmed by the feedback we&apos;ve received. We want to keep telling stories and give awareness to all those who don&apos;t have a platform to project their stories or struggles,&#x201D; communication sophomore Hissa Al-Mannai said of her award-winning film which examines the Palestinian identity. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Muhammad%20Shakir,%20Winner%20for%20Research,%20Social%20Sciences-17.jpg\" alt=\"Muhammad Shakir, Winner for Research, Social Sciences.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n The Media and Research Awards marks the conclusion of NU-Q&#x2019;s &#x201C;Go Wild Week,&#x201D; the annual spirit week on campus.
