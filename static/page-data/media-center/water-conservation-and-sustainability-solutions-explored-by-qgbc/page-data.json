We need to explore whether this is the time to consider the deployment of new technologies for local water treatment that can substantially improve our built environment.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Stephen Herd, Business Development Manager of Polypipe, said, &#x201C;The conventional approach to storm water management is treating rainfall as waste rather than as a resource, but sustainable storm water design treats rainfall runoff as a valuable resource.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/20-11-2013%20-%20QGBC%20Future%20Planning%20of%20Water%20Strategy_English_Final.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf66","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/water-conservation-and-sustainability-solutions-explored-by-qgbc","currSlug":"/media-center/water-conservation-and-sustainability-solutions-explored-by-qgbc","title":"Water Conservation And Sustainability Solutions Explored By QGBC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
