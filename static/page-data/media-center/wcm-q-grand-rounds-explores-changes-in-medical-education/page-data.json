The largely independent nature of this form of learning means students are less dependent on traditional learning experiences, like lectures, meaning colleges must adapt their programs to maximize learning outcomes. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo3-17.jpg\" alt=\"Photo3.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"425\"><br>\n Dr. Desai, who is also chief medical officer at a hi-tech online medical learning platform, said: &#x201C;At many medical colleges it is very common for the attendance at lectures to be as low as 15 or 20 percent, in part because it is simply not a good use of a student&#x2019;s time to travel halfway across the city to obtain information they can find online quickly, easily and from high-quality sources. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;This doesn&#x2019;t mean medical colleges are becoming redundant. What it means is that colleges have an opportunity to use technology to make information acquisition far more efficient, leaving them time to focus on other core learning goals such as skills acquisition, critical thinking, group work, professionalism training, cultural competence and patient-doctor interactions.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Desai said that learning science research indicates that medical colleges should be investing in hi-tech simulation centers to help students gain important practical skills, maximizing access to quality online resources, encouraging students to be open to new technologies, and introducing students to clinical learning experiences very early in the curriculum. All of these elements have been incorporated into WCM-Q&#x2019;s new curriculum, which was launched in 2016. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Desai also stressed the need equip students with the skills and mindset to be lifelong learners. &#x201C;We know that the world of medicine is changing extremely rapidly,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The students of today will still be practicing in 30 to 40 years&#x2019; time so it is crucial that we prepare them to adapt to changes so they can continue to provide the best possible care for their patients.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170529%20English%20WCM-Q%20Grand%20Rounds%20explores%20the%20changing%20world%20of%20medical%20education.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf92","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-grand-rounds-explores-changes-in-medical-education","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-grand-rounds-explores-changes-in-medical-education","title":"WCM-Q Grand Rounds Explores Changes in Medical Education"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
