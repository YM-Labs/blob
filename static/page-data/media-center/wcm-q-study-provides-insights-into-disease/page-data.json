Epigenetic marks are like little flags &#x2013; their presence or absence at specific locations on the genome can tell how well a cell is faring in its response to a health challenge. For instance, some of them can serve as early indicators for the onset of diabetes.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Their study was entitled &#x2018;Deep molecular phenotypes link complex disorders and physiological insult to CpG methylation&#x2019; and is the first study that analyzes such a broad spectrum of molecular measurements, including metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics and glycomics to measure all possible kinds of small molecules that can be found in blood, urine and saliva. <br>\n <br>\n This study has now been published in the prestigious international journal Human Molecular Genetics and can be accessed at the following URL: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddy006\">https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddy006</a>.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Khaled Machaca, associate dean for research at WCM-Q, said: &#x201C;These biomarkers could help with the early diagnosis of certain cancers, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, and may one day allow doctors to begin therapies earlier, ultimately improving clinical outcomes. These biomarkers could also allow patients to make timely lifestyle changes, perhaps even avoiding the disease altogether. The results of this study advance WCM-Q&#x2019;s research program on addressing the most prevalent and challenging health needs in Qatar and the region.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180222%20English%20WCM-Q%20study%20provides%20insights%20into%20disease.pdf\">here</a><br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf42","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-study-provides-insights-into-disease","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-study-provides-insights-into-disease","title":"WCM-Q Study Provides Insights into Disease"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
