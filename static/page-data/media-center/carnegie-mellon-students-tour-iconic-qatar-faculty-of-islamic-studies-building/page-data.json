The building relates back to the concept of &#x2018;Kulliya&#x2019; which means totality in Arabic, and represents where faith and education intertwine. This inter-connectedness is reflected in the QFIS structure, which consists of informal indoor and outdoor learning areas, and features a library and a mosque.<br>\n <br>\n Kelly Hutzell, associate teaching professor of architecture at Carnegie Mellon, organized the visit alongside Ameena Ahmadi, technical director of Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s capital projects and facilities management, and Louis Saleh, senior project manager at Astad. <br>\n <br>\n Carnegie Mellon Qatar offers undergraduate programs in biological sciences, business administration, computational biology, computer science and information systems. However, the university encourages students to take courses outside of their major program of study and in a wide range of academic disciplines. <br>\n <br>\n These courses complement what students are learning in their majors and provide them with the opportunity to pursue special areas of interests, such as architecture. The School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh is ranked in the top 10 professional architecture degree programs in the United States. Taught by renowned faculty from the program, students on the Qatar campus have the option of completing a minor in the field.<br>\n <br>\n <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>\n <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>\n <o:AllowPNG />\n </o:OfficeDocumentSettings>\n </xml><![endif]-->\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/7-1-14_CMU-Q%20visit%20Qatar%20Faculty%20of%20Islamic%20Studies_EN_FINAL.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2qf71","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/carnegie-mellon-students-tour-iconic-qatar-faculty-of-islamic-studies-building","currSlug":"/media-center/carnegie-mellon-students-tour-iconic-qatar-faculty-of-islamic-studies-building","title":"Carnegie Mellon Students Tour Iconic Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies Building"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
