The samples from that group revealed high levels of obesity, diabetes and Vitamin D deficiency. <br>\n Representatives from biomedical institutions in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt and Africa also presented their research and took part in a panel discussion on the possible formation of a regional biobank network.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;As we begin to gain more insight on the health of the local population, we are also beginning to look at how we can expand that picture. This conference is an excellent example of the value of collaboration, and can serve as a stepping-stone for future discussions about a regional biobank network,&#x201D; said Dr. Afifi. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_Qatar%20Biobank%20Conference%20Closing%20_PR__En%2020170315.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf65","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-biobank-conference-concludes-with-call-for-regional-cooperation","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-biobank-conference-concludes-with-call-for-regional-cooperation","title":"Qatar Biobank Conference Concludes With Call for Regional Cooperation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
