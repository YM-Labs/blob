The programme also included body composition analysis for employees. <br>\n <br>\n The program&#x2019;s annual calendar will feature smoking cessation sessions; family events to which employees will invite their families to attend health and wellness awareness workshops including healthy diets, kids&#x2019; safety and others. <br>\n <br>\n Additionally, Vodafone&#x2019;s Employee Wellness Programme will encompass staff immunization and blood screening to check cholesterol and diabetes levels and help staff identify any alarming health issue in its early stages.
