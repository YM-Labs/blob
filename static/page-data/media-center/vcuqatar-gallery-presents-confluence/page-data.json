The event is open to the public.<br>\n <br>\n The photograph is part of everyday life around the world and is used as a medium to preserve fleeting moments of the mundane, the personal, and the intimate, as well as the monumental, the global and the public. <br>\n <br>\n This exhibition of contemporary photography and video installation from across the Middle East demonstrates this thematic diversity. Beyond this, however, it also explores the medium itself &#x2013; the richness of possibilities, directions and journeys that are open to the artist who uses photography in its broadest sense as a starting point or confluence in his/her work. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Confluence%20press%20release%20.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24qf78","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/vcuqatar-gallery-presents-confluence","currSlug":"/media-center/vcuqatar-gallery-presents-confluence","title":"VCUQatar Gallery Presents: Confluence"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
