And in 2005, the Court of Cassation was established, the highest level in the judiciary sector.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Al-Khulaifi, who is a visiting fellow at SFS-Qatar for the upcoming academic year, described the process by which a law is passed in Qatar. A law proposal, which starts as a draft that is prepared by specialized legal committees in the Council of Ministries, is then presented to the Council of Ministers, after which, if it is passed, it is sent to the Shura Council for consideration. <br>\n <img width=\"452\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/ZO9A0865-9.jpg\" alt=\"ZO9A0865.jpg\"><br>\n If approved by the Shura Council, it returns to the original Council of Ministers so that a decision can be issued to refer the draft in its final form to the Office of His Highness, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of Qatar for issuance. Finally, a signed law is sent to the relevant department in the Ministry of Justice for publication in the official Gazette of the State, in preparation for implementation in public life.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Al-Khulaifi also discussed the challenges of ensuring that commercial laws keep pace with Qatar&#x2019;s rapid economic development, saying: &#x201C;Qatar is engaged in a tremendous number of high-valued projects, valuing approximately $250 billion, according to projectqatar.com. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Al-Khulaifi is also the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs at Qatar University, and is frequently consulted by governmental institutions to present his legal opinions on matters related to commercial legislation in the state of Qatar.He received the State PhD award from His Highness, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of Qatar at Qatar Education Excellence Day in 2012.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Georgetown&#x2019;s website, please <a href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/news/QatariLawyerSharesInsightsIntoTheQatariLegalSystemAtGeorgetownLecture\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>clickhere</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf10","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatari-lawyer-shares-insights-into-the-qatari-legal-system-at-sfs-qatar-lecture","currSlug":"/media-center/qatari-lawyer-shares-insights-into-the-qatari-legal-system-at-sfs-qatar-lecture","title":"Qatari Lawyer Shares Insights into the Qatari Legal System at SFS-Qatar Lecture"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
