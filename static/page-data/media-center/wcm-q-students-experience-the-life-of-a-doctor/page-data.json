The students are able to accompany doctors on their patient rounds, participate in morning conferences, and watch surgeons in the operating theater. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Rachid Bendriss, assistant dean for student recruitment, outreach and foundation programs, said the goal was to expose students not yet learning the medical curriculum to the healthcare system.<br>\n Dr. Bendriss said the program allows them to learn about the daily routine of physicians, become familiar with the various medical specialties open to them, and reflect on their experiences at HMC.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo3-17.jpg\" alt=\"Photo3.jpg\" height=\"389\" width=\"640\"><br>\n This year, 56 WCM-Q students participated in the scheme during the college&#x2019;s winter break.<br>\n Pre-medical 1 student Sumaya Maraghi, was one of them. She chose to spend time in HMC&#x2019;s Department of Pediatrics. She said: &#x201C;It was interesting. It changed my perception of pediatrics, which I thought was just dealing with children and fairly simple diseases. But there are a lot of facets to it and the children can&#x2019;t always tell you what&#x2019;s wrong or where it hurts, so it&#x2019;s the doctor&#x2019;s job to work it out and find the problem. I thought it as very challenging and an amazing field to work in. I was lucky enough to be part of a very helpful and cooperative team who really showed me what the specialty involves. They had such great communication with each other and really discussed the cases, they were amazing, I wanted to continue working with them.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Nasser Al-Kuwari, who also visited Surgical Department, summed the experience up. He said: &#x201C;It was an exciting experience and interesting to see how the doctors communicate with different patients, particularly those who do not speak Arabic. &#x201C;The experience showed me what it feels like to be a doctor.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170314%20English%20WCM-Q%20students%20experience%20the%20life%20of%20a%20doctor.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf38","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-students-experience-the-life-of-a-doctor","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-students-experience-the-life-of-a-doctor","title":"WCM-Q Students Experience the Life of a Doctor"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
