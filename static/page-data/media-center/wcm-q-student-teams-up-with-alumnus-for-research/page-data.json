The Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics is an official publication of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine.<br>\n <br>\n Aya said: &#x201C;I am very happy to see my research published and extremely grateful to Dr. Nigel Pereira for being such a proactive and encouraging mentor. His guidance, knowledge and passion for his work was so beneficial and inspiring, and it was great to be able to work with a fellow member of the WCM-Q community.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The research paper studied the cases of 763 female patients; 217 of Arab Peninsula ethnicity and 546 Caucasians, and used a statistical modeling technique to compare the success of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) between the two groups. The study found that women of Arabian Peninsula heritage responded less well to ART than the Caucasian Group. The study also found that Qatari women in the Arab group responded more positively to ART than women from other parts of the region. All data used in the study was anonymized.<br>\n <br>\n WCM-Q&#x2019;s six-year medical curriculum is designed to give students multiple opportunities to conduct their own research in order to produce physician-scientists who not only provide excellent care but also drive progress in medical science. Aya&#x2019;s research at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York was supported by the Medical Student Research Award, an initiative that facilitates research experiences for students who demonstrate an aptitude for scientific enquiry. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Pereira, who now holds the position of Assistant Professor of Reproductive Medicine and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine-New York, provided mentorship to Aya throughout her research experience. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/171115%20English%20WCM-Q%20student%20teams%20up%20with%20alumnus%20for%20research%20success.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf37","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-student-teams-up-with-alumnus-for-research","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-student-teams-up-with-alumnus-for-research","title":"WCM-Q Student Teams up with Alumnus for Research"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
