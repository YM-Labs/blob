His expertise is in the development of young STEM educators, specifically in learning, cognition and instruction in engineering and technology education. <br>\n <br>\n During his presentation, de Miranda discussed the increasing importance of preparing young learners for STEM subjects, particularly in nations that are leading technological advances. De Miranda said, the sustainable growth and development of tomorrow&#x2019;s thought leaders is happening in our schools and classrooms today, and educators must act to transform classroom lessons into educational experiences for students. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/FR5R4147%5B2%5D%5B3%5D-24.jpg\" alt=\"FR5R4147[2][3].jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n &#x201C;Humans are born designers,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We change our environments to meet our needs and wants, and we must use engineering and design to engage young students. But learning depends on perspective, and our role is to clarify this perspective by integrating STEM subjects to see how they work together. Seeing the whole picture helps students learn, so we must connect the STEM dots in a unified knowledge base. If we don&#x2019;t connect the STEM dots, we create in students an aversion to learning basic STEM concepts.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n De Miranda also emphasized the importance of transforming STEM classrooms into learning communities where students can share and exchange learning and ideas. Most importantly, though, de Miranda challenged teachers to unleash the power of engineering to create powerful STEM learners. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Engineers fail more than we succeed,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;In a STEM classroom, we should reward failure as long as our students can figure out why they failed. We must get students to reflect on what they don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;&#xA0;<br>\n <br>\n To read more, click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Texas%20A_26M%20at%20Qatar%20hosts%20STEM%20education%20workshop%20for%20local%20teachers%20-%20English.pdf\">here</a>.</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf37","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/texas-am-at-qatar-hosts-stem-workshop-for-teachers","currSlug":"/media-center/texas-am-at-qatar-hosts-stem-workshop-for-teachers","title":"Texas A&M at Qatar Hosts STEM Workshop for Teachers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
