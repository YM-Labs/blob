This essential human right is a cornerstone of sustainable development and global security. Recognized as a subject of such importance, the World Bank Group has identified UHC as a top priority for sustainable development. <br>\n <br>\n Recent research looking into the health of 2035 showed that for every USD1 invested in health today, we could reap $20 increase in income over the next 20 years. To date more than 80 countries have asked the World Health Organization (WHO) for help in moving toward UHC, including the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.<br>\n <br>\n Recognizing December 12 as an important day, WISH has released a video on its website of UHC Forum Chair Sir David Nicholson, former Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England, who introduces the importance of UHC ahead of presenting the Forum&#x2019;s exclusive insights at the second global summit in February 2015.
