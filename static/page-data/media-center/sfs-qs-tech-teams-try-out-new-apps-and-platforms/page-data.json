The possibilities with that kind of technology, available through applications for the iPad, are what is driving Georgetown University - School of Foreign Service in Qatar (SFS-Q) Office of Academic Services (OAS) to explore and use current technology to help Georgetown students achieve their best academically.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Putting resources in the hands of the students,&#x201D; that&#x2019;s how Anne Nebel, Georgetown University SFS-Q Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs, describes the goal of the technology initiative under development in OAS. <br>\n <br>\n She explains, &#x201C;In OAS the focus is to support student achievement across the curriculum. We have looked at apps related to economics, geography, French and Arabic as foreign languages, and academic writing across the disciplines.&#x201D; But, as Nebel points out, student achievement is more than mastering a course.<br>\n <br>\n Whether it&#x2019;s brainstorming for the next paper, managing one&#x2019;s time, creating an outline structure, developing a thesis, or writing citations, there are essential areas of learning that, depending on a student&#x2019;s strengths or weaknesses, may be enhanced through technology.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Because we are in this unique and exciting and very multi-lingual society and context, we see students with lots of different strengths and with different kinds of needs,&#x201D; says Nebel. &#x201C;We try as best we can to identify student strengths,&#x201D; she adds, &#x201C;and help them to find ways to build on their weaknesses.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n OAS is also looking at new technologies to assist students with learning differences. Nebel gives as an example Dragon NaturallySpeaking, a speech to text software that records speech and converts it to text that students can use as notes.<br>\n When reviewing the range of new technologies, Nebel says, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re trying it. We&#x2019;re piloting it. If it makes it easier, we&#x2019;ll run with it.&#x201D;<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf7","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sfs-qs-tech-teams-try-out-new-apps-and-platforms","currSlug":"/media-center/sfs-qs-tech-teams-try-out-new-apps-and-platforms","title":"SFS-Q’s Tech Teams Try Out New Apps and Platforms"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
