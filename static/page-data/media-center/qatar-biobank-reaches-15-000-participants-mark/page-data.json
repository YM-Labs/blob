However, the tests carried out also include new screenings that are not included in other large-scale biobanks, including advanced imaging techniques to measure whole-body composition and the health of carotid arteries, and a treadmill test to measure physical fitness.<br>\n <br>\n Qatar Biobank welcomes Qataris over the age of 18 and adult expatriates who have lived in Qatar for at least 15 years to take part in this pioneering medical research endeavor. All participants receive feedback approximately two weeks after their initial visit; however, Qatar Biobank immediately notifies participants who are found to have serious or life-threatening conditions. <br>\n <br>\n For more information about Qatar Biobank, please visit: <a href=\"http://www.qatarbiobank.org.qa/home\">www.qatarbiobank.org.qa/home </a><br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf71","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-biobank-reaches-15-000-participants-mark","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-biobank-reaches-15-000-participants-mark","title":"Qatar Biobank Reaches 15,000 Participants Mark"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
