Students working with the mannequins can practice responding to an almost limitless array of conditions as if they were in a real ER (emergency room), such as a cardiac arrest, respiratory infections, heatstroke or even childbirth. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/6CD528D7-E802-424C-973C-AEEEBACCC0CB-17.jpg\" alt=\"6CD528D7-E802-424C-973C-AEEEBACCC0CB.png\" height=\"426\" width=\"584\"><br>\n The CSSL, formerly known as the Clinical Skills Center, has been expanded from 8,500 to 10,500 square feet and now has 12 clinical examination rooms, up from six previously. Each examination room is fully equipped with diagnostic instruments for examining the ears and eyes and measuring blood pressure and temperature. Students learn to utilize these instruments under instructor supervision and with the help of &#x2018;standardized patients&#x2019; &#x2013; individuals trained to play the role of patients. <br>\n <br>\n Other facilities in the revamped suite include hi-tech training aids for practicing administering joint injections, taking blood samples, inserting intravenous lines and using portable ultrasound machines. There is also a cardiopulmonary patient simulator and a variety of 3D anatomical models. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/E138337F-05C7-48EE-82D7-92B784EAE7A1-17.jpg\" alt=\"E138337F-05C7-48EE-82D7-92B784EAE7A1.png\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n Simulation-based learning is a key emerging trend in the education of medical practitioners and numerous other health professions. Research has shown that students and qualified healthcare practitioners who practice and retain their expert skills in a simulated environment have markedly higher success rates in performing a variety of medical procedures and see a dramatic reduction in errors in patient care, thereby enhancing patient safety. They also show improved teamwork and inter-professional communication and enjoy greater professional fulfillment<br>\n <br>\n Working with standardized patients allows medical students to develop critical interpersonal skills that help put patients at ease, while working in teams on practical tasks accurately recreates real-world clinical practice. Having begun with 12 standardized patients back in 2005, WCM-Q now has about 75 standardized patients. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170930%20English%20WCM-Q%20launches%20hi-tech%20medical%20skills%20lab.pdf\">here</a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf10","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-launches-hi-tech-medical-skills-lab","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-launches-hi-tech-medical-skills-lab","title":"WCM-Q Launches Hi-Tech Medical Skills Lab"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
