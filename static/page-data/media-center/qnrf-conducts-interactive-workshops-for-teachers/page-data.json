Through these workshops, QNRF presented its policies and guidelines for preparing final reports on SSREP projects and addressed concerns previously raised by teachers and students, including how to correctly reference academic material from a third party. SSREP, a joint initiative with the Supreme Education Council (SEC), is one of QNRF&#x2019;s key funding programs, and aims to promote a culture of science and research at an early stage in students&#x2019; lives.</p>\n <p>QNRF officials led the workshops between 5 and 7 March 2013 at their offices in West Bay, with the first day catering to male secondary school teachers and the second day designated for female teachers. The third day saw attendance from teachers of both genders from private schools across the country.</p>\n <p>Dr Abdulla Al-Kamali, SSREP Program Officer, described the purpose of the Program and its workshops, saying, &#x201C;SSREP is intended to enrich the learning experiences of secondary school students by helping them develop science and research skills, which will be valuable in their future academic and professional careers.&#x201D;</p>\n <p>SSREP plays an important role in enhancing productive collaboration between teachers and students. Pupils are encouraged to undertake research, under the mentorship of their tutors, in projects that are directly derived from SEC-accredited curriculum standards.</p>\n <p>In previous cycles, secondary school students have completed research on a range of topics. These include an exploration of environmentally-friendly methods for maintaining comfortable temperatures in buildings in Qatar, an examination of the effects of participation in sport on respiratory volumes, heart rates and blood pressure in adolescent females and a study assessing the impact of wives on their husbands&apos; lives in Shakespeare&#x2019;s <em>Julius Caesar</em> and <em>Macbeth</em>.</p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf32","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qnrf-conducts-interactive-workshops-for-teachers","currSlug":"/media-center/qnrf-conducts-interactive-workshops-for-teachers","title":"QNRF Conducts Interactive Workshops For Teachers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
