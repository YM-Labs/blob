Many people mistakenly believe that shisha is not as harmful or addictive as smoking cigarettes. In fact, shisha can be more harmful because of the way it is smoked. <br>\n <br>\n In fact, chemical analysis of waterpipe and cigarette smoke conducted by Professor Eissenberg found that the smoke from a forty-five-minute shisha session exposed a smoker to 1.7 times the amount of nicotine, contained 8.4 times the amount of harmful carbon monoxide and 36 times the amount of tar, over a five-minute period.<br>\n <br>\n Just like cigarette smokers, shisha smokers put themselves at greater risk of diseases like bronchitis, emphysema, periodontal disease and lung cancer.</div>\n &#xA0;<br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160516%20English%20Harmful%20effects%20of%20shisha%20discussed%20at%20WCM-Q-s%20Grand%20Rounds.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf15","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/harmful-effects-of-shisha-discussed-at-wcm-qs-grand-rounds","currSlug":"/media-center/harmful-effects-of-shisha-discussed-at-wcm-qs-grand-rounds","title":"Harmful Effects of Shisha Discussed at WCM-Q’s Grand Rounds"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
