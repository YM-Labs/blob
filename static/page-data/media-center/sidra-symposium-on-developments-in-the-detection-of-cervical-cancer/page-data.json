Introduction of the Pap test in structured screening programs in the early 1960s has proven remarkably successful, leading to a greater than 70 percent reduction in both the mortality and incidence of cervical cancer in those regions.<br>\n <br>\n Without intervention, it is projected that 530,000 additional annual cases of cervical cancer, and a near 25 percent increase in the next 10 years. The majority of these cases (88 percent) are expected to occur primarily in regions where less than 5 percent of women have access to screening, for even once in their lifetime.<br>\n <br>\n &#x2018;The 1st Century of Gynecological Cytopathology: The Pap Test &#x2013; Then, Now and the Future&#x2019; was the latest in a series of symposia hosted by Sidra to raise awareness of key health issues affecting women and children.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Sidra&#x2019;s website, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sidra.org/sidra-medical-and-research-center-hosts-symposium-to-celebrate-a-century-of-breakthroughs-in-gynecological-cytopathology/\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf80","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-symposium-on-developments-in-the-detection-of-cervical-cancer","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-symposium-on-developments-in-the-detection-of-cervical-cancer","title":"Sidra Symposium on Developments in the Detection of Cervical Cancer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
