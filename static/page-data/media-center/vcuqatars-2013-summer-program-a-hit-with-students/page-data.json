The 12 youngest students (four Qatari) in the Art Fun class transformed the Gallery into a wonderland of color, shapes and incredible creations in a whole variety of media.<br>\n <br>\n All students were introduced to the world of art and design through many different art and design projects using a broad range of media, group work and discussions, and exposure to professional work with increasing levels of intensity depending on the age groups. <br>\n <br>\n Students visited the Museum of Islamic Art and other commercial art galleries where they were taken on tours and afterwards worked on individual assignments to process what they had seen, and created art to be used in their own final projects. <br>\n <br>\n <br>\n The next set of Community Classes and Portfolio Development Classes will start in October 2013. <br>\n <br>\n Details will be available on the VCUQatar website <a href=\"http://www.qatar.vcu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">www.qatar.vcu.edu</a>.<br>\n <br>\n <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/VCUQatarSummerPrograms.pdf\"> For the full story, please click here.</a><br>\n <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf8","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/vcuqatars-2013-summer-program-a-hit-with-students","currSlug":"/media-center/vcuqatars-2013-summer-program-a-hit-with-students","title":"VCUQatar’s 2013 Summer Program A Hit With Students"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
