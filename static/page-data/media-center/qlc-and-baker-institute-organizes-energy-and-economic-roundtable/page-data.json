In each session, attendees engaged in high-level deliberation on how to effectively address challenges in a range of areas related to energy policies - energy subsidy reform, economic diversification, the food-energy-water production nexus and climate change. <br>\n <br>\n On the first session of day one, deliberations focused on the implications of energy subsidies in the GCC and their impact on domestic consumption and exports. Experts lent insight on how policymakers can address subsidy costs while simultaneously continuing to maintain a high standard of living. Session two dealt exclusively with economic diversification. <br>\n <br>\n On the Roundtable&#x2019;s second day, experts addressed the linkages between food, energy and water production and how the region can reinvest its gains from energy resources to develop sustainable food and water production capacity. <br>\n <br>\n Qatar Leadership Centre and Rice University&#x2019;s Baker Institute will produce a series of policy recommendations based on insights gained from the Roundtable&#x2019;s sessions and the research papers presented. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170218%20Post%20Event%20QLC-Baker%20Conference%20-%20EN.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf82","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qlc-and-baker-institute-organizes-energy-and-economic-roundtable","currSlug":"/media-center/qlc-and-baker-institute-organizes-energy-and-economic-roundtable","title":"QLC and Baker Institute Organizes Energy and Economic Roundtable"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
