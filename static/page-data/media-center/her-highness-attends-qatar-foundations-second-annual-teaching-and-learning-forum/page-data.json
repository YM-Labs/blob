Sir Ken emphasized the importance of placing creativity at the heart of education, saying: &#x201C;We live in revolutionary times in education, in the sense that many values that we have taken for granted over time simply don&#x2019;t apply. If we are to meet this revolution, collectively, globally, then we have to question these values, think differently, behave differently, and we have to run our institutions differently, especially our education institutions. Most of our institutions were designed, invented, conceived of in other times for other purposes. Simply attempting to tighten up or make more efficient, a model that is past its expiry date will not work. We need a different way to do things.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The event featured 80 workshops divided into three different sessions. Addressing different topics, the sessions were carefully selected to hone the skills and knowledge of the participating teachers. The workshops focused on critical issues that will promote innovative instructional practices in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), in Early Childhood Education (children from the ages of 6 months to 5 years), and in Arabic Language Teaching and other subjects taught in schools.<br>\n <img width=\"639\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%203-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3.jpg\"><br>\n Additionally, following the opening ceremony, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between Qatar Foundation and the International Baccalaureate (IB) represented respectively by Engineer Saad Al Muhannadi, President of Qatar Foundation, and Dr Siva Kumari, Director General of the International Baccalaureate. The agreement aims to promote research and hold joint conferences to support the growth of educators in Qatar, and the region. IB will also provide access to experts in order to build internal capabilities, and together, the organizations will identify further areas of mutual interest.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/09%2005%202015_EDI_Post%20PR_EN_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</strong><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8qf84","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/her-highness-attends-qatar-foundations-second-annual-teaching-and-learning-forum","currSlug":"/media-center/her-highness-attends-qatar-foundations-second-annual-teaching-and-learning-forum","title":"Her Highness Attends Qatar Foundation’s Second Annual Teaching and Learning Forum"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
