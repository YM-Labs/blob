The informal meeting was a transnational effort to share best practices in education from policymakers around the world who discussed a variety of ideas &#x2013; from fostering innovation through curriculums, to innovative funding mechanisms.<br>\n <br>\n The session was hosted by the Chairman of WISE, HE Sheikh Abdulla bin Ali Al-Thani, PhD, who said: &#x201C;WISE was established to bring education to the top of the global agenda as a key to building secure and thriving societies.This meeting, in which the education ministers discussed their ideas on innovative and effective policy-making, is a step toward achieving that goal.&quot; <br>\n <br>\n He added: &quot;WISE is a multisectoral platform where decision-makers interact directly with a great variety of education stakeholders, providing rich opportunities for partnerships with the goal of putting the best, most effective practices into action.&quot;<br>\n <br>\n The Session provoked questions about how Ministries of Education from around the world have managed to make innovation a reality, whether the role of a policymaker is to implement policies developed to foster innovation or replicate best practices from the field, and how forums like WISE facilitate in the sharing of these practices.<br>\n <br>\n Qatar Education Minister, Dr Mohammed Abdul Wahed Ali al Hammadi said: &#x201C;The Ministers Session at WISE has provided us with a platform to discuss experiences from around the world, allowing us to explore new approaches and share different methods of working. In Qatar, we need to develop the education sector in the country in order to promote individual performance and productivity. Innovation in education is key to support the realization of Qatar&apos;s overall national development goals and position Qatar as a leading knowledge economy, in line with Qatar National Vision 2030.&quot;<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on the WISE website, please <a href=\"http://www.media.wise-qatar.org/education-ministers-at-wise-explore-innovative-practices-in-policy-making-2/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf21","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/education-ministers-at-wise-explore-innovative-practices-in-policy-making","currSlug":"/media-center/education-ministers-at-wise-explore-innovative-practices-in-policy-making","title":"Education Ministers At WISE Explore Innovative Practices In Policy Making"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
