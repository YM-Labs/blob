Classes, which are offered in either Arabic or English, begin on October 16, 2016 and are open to all nationals and residents of Qatar over the age of 18. Participants are not required to have any previous qualification or degree in order to join the program. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Community classes are an opportunity for us to support the wider community in Qatar, beyond our current degree students,&#x201D; said Interim Associate Director of Executive &amp; Professional Education Ren&#xE9;e Gallant. &#x201C;We hope the courses will help members of the public refine their skills, discover new professional interests and become life-long learners.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Classes will be held at GU-Q&#x2019;s Education City campus and taught by a number of the University&#x2019;s staff and faculty members, as well as experts from a variety of industries. In order to cater to working professionals, all classes will be convened once a week in the evenings from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. <br>\n <br>\n A number of new courses have been added to the lineup, including Women in the Gulf, Introduction to Writing: Short Stories, Mobile Technology and Learning, How to become a Social Entrepreneur, Arabic Formal Writing, and Big Data and Analytics. Popular courses from previous sessions will also be offered, including Understanding Digital Marketing, Religion, Peace and Violence, Career and Life Design, and Your Website Made Easy: Introduction to WordPress for Personal and Professional Websites. <br>\n <br>\n While the community classes are not for formal credit, participants who attend at least five out of the six classes will receive a certificate of completion. To date, more than 300 students have taken part in the program, which GU-Q has offered since March 2015. <br>\n <br>\n GU-Q is offering a discount on fees for students who register before September 30, 2016.
