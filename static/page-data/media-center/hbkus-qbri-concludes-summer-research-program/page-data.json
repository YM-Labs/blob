The Summer Research Program is a highly competitive and rigorous, research-based internship program that aims to enhance the capabilities of aspiring researchers. <br>\n <br>\n Commenting on the program, Dr. Omar El-Agnaf, acting executive director of QBRI, said: &#x201C;Our summer internships are a gateway for students to experience what life on the cutting-edge of innovative biomedical research is like. We strive to ensure that merit-based talent from all over Qatar receives practical real-world research training and knowledge through our internships. Afterwards, we see that most students have channeled their passion into pursuing a research oriented career, and apply to graduate programs to continue working on their newfound passion.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Najlaa Al-Thani, a student at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar (CMU-Q) and an intern at QBRI for this summer, worked on a Parkinson&#x2019;s disease project. Talking about her experience, she said: &#x201C;Overall, it was an unforgettable experience that nurtured my love of research in the biomedical field. My mentor has taught me a great deal in terms of techniques and practical knowledge. She has also become an inspiration to me by being a successful female researcher in a very novel field.&#x201D;<br>\n Located in HBKU&#x2019;s Research Complex, QBRI&#x2019;s state-of-the-art facilities attract renowned scientists from Qatar and all over the world to conduct pioneering and innovative research on cancer, diabetes, or neurological disorders. The institute focuses on these three topics as they are an integral part of ensuring that the established healthcare goals of the country are reached.<br>\n <br>\n A student at Qatar University&#x2019;s College of Pharmacy, Ola Hussein says the program has helped her build on her knowledge in the biomedical field. &#x201C;Training at QBRI was a great experience and I would highly recommend any student interested in biomedical research to apply for next year&#x2019;s program,&#x201D; she said. <br>\n <br>\n To learn more about how HBKU&#x2019;s QBRI is contributing towards the sustainable development of Qatar through innovative projects and collaborative partnerships, visit <a href=\"http://hbku.edu.qa\">hbku.edu.qa</a>.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/171007%20-%20QBRI%20SRP%20Interns%20-%20EN.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf75","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbkus-qbri-concludes-summer-research-program","currSlug":"/media-center/hbkus-qbri-concludes-summer-research-program","title":"HBKU’s QBRI Concludes Summer Research Program"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
