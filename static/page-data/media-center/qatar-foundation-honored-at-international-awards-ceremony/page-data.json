The design architects, Ali Mangera and Ada Yvars Bravo studied the Muslim landmarks across history and distilled their research in values that they then depicted within the building&#x2019;s spaces. They mainly focused on two notions: knowledge and light.The entire building, combining both the faculty and the mosque, carry numerous symbols and poetic references to Islam and its civilization.<br>\n <img width=\"639\" height=\"426\" alt=\"Image 1.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%201-17.jpg\"><br>\n QF also received the &#x2018;Ramboll Sustainable Project of the Year&#x2019; Award in recognition of the fact that the Foundation is currently producing up to 85 per cent of Qatar&#x2019;s total solar energy.
