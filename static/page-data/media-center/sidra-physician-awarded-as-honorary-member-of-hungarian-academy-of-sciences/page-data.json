The award is reserved for distinguished Hungarian academicians and scholars who have made internationally recognized contributions to various fields of science. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Dr.%20Istvan%20Seri%20-%20Sidra.jpg\" alt=\"null\" width=\"3024\" height=\"2016\"><br>\n As Division Chief of Neonatology, Dr. Seri is in charge of the Neonatology Prenatal Consultation Clinic at the Sidra Outpatient Clinic. He was nominated for his work in developmental cardiovascular physiology1 and neonatal hemodynamics and neonatal shock. The vast body of his research focused on neonatal transition from in-utero life to postnatal life (from fetus to after delivery). <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The Hungarian Academy of Science has many leading scientists, researchers and clinicians in its midst. It is a source of pride for me to be recognized by peers from our profession. I am honoured to receive the recognition. However, the ultimate reward is to see the culmination of my research positively impact on saving lives, during every step of a baby&#x2019;s journey from womb to delivery. It gives me great pleasure that I am able to further my research at Sidra where clinical research is a strong focus,&#x201D; said Dr. Seri.<br>\n <br>\n The Sidra Outpatient Clinic launched its Neonatology Prenatal Consultation Clinic on 1 June 2016, where Dr. Seri and his team offer prenatal consultation services for pregnant women and their families with complex and high-risk pregnancies. The women and their families are given an opportunity to learn about the baby&#x2019;s condition and the available treatment options after delivery or, if warranted, during pregnancy.&#xA0; <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Together with the bioinformatics team at Sidra, we are currently working to develop comprehensive early warning systems via monitoring and data acquisition. This will help us establish individualized medicine and treatment methods for neonatal patients at Sidra. I hope that we will contribute towards a stronger understanding of life-saving methods for neonates and offer treatment choices in a culturally sensitive and family-centered manner,&#x201D; continued Dr. Seri.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Seri has been recognized as an international leader in the field of developmental cardiovascular physiology in general and neonatal hemodynamics and neonatal shock in particular. He has published over 250 peer-reviewed scientific publications, editorials, and chapters. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Seri is also the recipient of several awards for his educational and mentoring activities including the &#x201C;Semmelweis Award&#x2019; from Semmelweis Medical School, the &#x201C;Faculty Teacher of the Year Award&#x2019; and the &#x201C;Blockley-Osler Award for Excellence in Teaching Modern Clinical Medicine&#x2019; from University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and the Children&#x2019;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). In 2001, the &#x201C;Istvan Seri Faculty Teaching Award in Neonatology&#x2019; was established in the Department of Pediatrics and Division of Neonatology at CHOP and UPenn. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/2016_12_14%20-%20%20Dr.%20Istvan%20Seri%20Award%20-%20ENG.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf72","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-physician-awarded-as-honorary-member-of-hungarian-academy-of-sciences","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-physician-awarded-as-honorary-member-of-hungarian-academy-of-sciences","title":"Sidra Physician Awarded as Honorary Member of Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
