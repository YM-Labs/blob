While Arab children are able to speak their local dialect, they are often unable to communicate using Modern Standard Arabic, otherwise known as fus&#x2019;ha. <br>\n <img width=\"639\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Arabiyatti-17.jpg\" alt=\"Arabiyatti\"><br>\n &#x201C;There are common problems with teaching Arabic across the entire region, and Arabiyyatti is the result of research indicating the need to support educators by introducing them to updated teaching methods as well as recent linguistic theories that deal with language acquisition and learning. I hope the participating instructors gained value from the workshop, and that it will inspire them to use Arabiyyatti in their classrooms, not only for the benefit of their students, but also for the preservation of the Arabic language,&#x201D; Ibrahim said. <br>\n <br>\n The Arabiyyatti research team, led by Ibrahim, set out to not only help primary school students learn to read and write Arabic, but also build positive attitudes toward MSA by engaging them through interactive programming and gaming. The project was piloted at Qatar Academy in fall 2013, where it was known as the Aladdin project.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/3-3-15_CMU-Q%20Language%20Learning%20Workshop_EN_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2qf61","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/carnegie-mellon-qatar-hosts-workshop-on-arabic-language-learning-pedagogy","currSlug":"/media-center/carnegie-mellon-qatar-hosts-workshop-on-arabic-language-learning-pedagogy","title":"Carnegie Mellon Qatar Hosts Workshop on Arabic Language Learning Pedagogy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
