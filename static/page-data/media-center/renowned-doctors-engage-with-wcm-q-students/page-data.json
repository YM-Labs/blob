The event gives residency program directors an opportunity to get to know WCM-Q and its facilities, learn about the college&#x2019;s curriculum and gives students the opportunity to ask questions in an informal environment, enabling them to find out about the admission criteria of the residency programs.<br>\n <img src=\"https://cdn.qf.com.qa/app/media/44771\" alt=\"4- Group Photo.JPG\"><br>\n This year&apos;s event brought 13 directors from elite medical schools and teaching hospitals from across the US, who are responsible for admitting medical school graduates to competitive residency programs.

It is the goal of WCM-Q to have its graduates return to Qatar upon completion of their training to contribute to the growth of the country&#x2019;s healthcare system.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160313%20English%20Trainee%20physicians%20impress%20visiting%20doctors.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a><strong>.</strong><br>\n <br>\n &#xA0;</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20qf18","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/renowned-doctors-engage-with-wcm-q-students","currSlug":"/media-center/renowned-doctors-engage-with-wcm-q-students","title":"Renowned Doctors Engage With WCM-Q Students"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
