In addition to receiving guidance, resources and training, the students were also driven to displaying their own careful planning in order to overcome any obstacles.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/10-%2005-20%2014-QNRF%20Science%20Challange%20PR_ENGLISH.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2qf43","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/budding-young-scientists-compete-in-qatar-national-research-fund-and-supreme-education-councils-science-challenge","currSlug":"/media-center/budding-young-scientists-compete-in-qatar-national-research-fund-and-supreme-education-councils-science-challenge","title":"Budding Young Scientists Compete in Qatar National Research Fund and Supreme Education Council’s Science Challenge"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
