They can be dealt with and are being dealt with in Qatar, one step at a time.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n El Mir called for public education and the importance of local solutions when tackling water scarcity in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n During the event, QGBC facilitated five round table discussions with each focusing on a different response to addressing water scarcity in Qatar. Topics included Policy, Market Conditions, Education and Public Awareness, Design and Construction Practices, and Availability of Information. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/20-05-2014_QGBC%20Watar%20Seminar%20Post%20PR_English.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf43","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/experts-discuss-solutions-to-qatars-water-scarcity-challenges","currSlug":"/media-center/experts-discuss-solutions-to-qatars-water-scarcity-challenges","title":"Experts Discuss Solutions to Qatar’s Water Scarcity Challenges"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
