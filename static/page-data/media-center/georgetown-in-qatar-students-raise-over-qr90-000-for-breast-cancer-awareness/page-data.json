In just four hours, the club surpassed their previous year&#x2019;s fundraising by nearly QR50,000.<br>\n <br>\n Twelve vendors, ranging from Sugar &amp; Spice to Impressions Boutique, donated their goods to raise funds for cancer patients. Newly introduced this year was the auctioning of four luxury items: a 24K gold-plated iPhone 5, a special edition gold Q10 Blackberry, two Golden Roses (auctioned as a set) and two luxury Alexander McQueen clutches (auctioned as a set). The Qatar Cancer Society was on hand to collect the money raised at the 100 percent non-profit event.<br>\n <br>\n An additional WSDC activity during Breast Cancer Awareness Month included a Hoya mascot canvas where Georgetown and Qatar Foundation community members wrote inspirational messages for cancer patients.<br>\n <br>\n In 2010, inspired by the diversity in the cultural backgrounds of the female students at SFS-Qatar, several Georgetown students decided to establish the WSDC. WSDC was created as a platform for students to discuss, to embrace and to better understand the roles and challenges of being a woman. Today the club&#x2019;s aims include the empowerment and education of women on various contemporary and traditional issues.<br>\n <br>\n WSDC also has a women&#x2019;s development aspect and organizes professional workshops and leadership opportunities for club members and all SFS-Qatar students. WSDC works in affiliation with the SFS-Qatar Women&#x2019;s Center, which is a branch of the Georgetown University Women&#x2019;s Center in Washington, DC.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Georgetown&#x2019;s website, please <a href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/419603.html#.UnjhK1PwW1Q\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf83","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/georgetown-in-qatar-students-raise-over-qr90-000-for-breast-cancer-awareness","currSlug":"/media-center/georgetown-in-qatar-students-raise-over-qr90-000-for-breast-cancer-awareness","title":"Georgetown In Qatar Students Raise Over QR90,000 For Breast Cancer Awareness"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
