Dr. Yehia Abdelmobdy Mohamed, Assistant Professor of Arabic at GU-Q and organizer of the roundtable, pointed out that the discussion started by comparing ACTFL to the European framework in regard to their historical and cultural contexts, vision, goals, and description of standards and linguistic levels for each of them. <br>\n <br>\n The roundtable also highlighted CEFRL&#x2019;s various linguistic levels and skills, in addition to designing curricula, tests and assessment tools according to this framework. Some papers that were presented throughout the discussions elaborated on the unique characteristics of the Arabic language and its cultural ingredients.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/ZO9A9525.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"1325\" width=\"1987\"><br>\n The event is part of the Arabic Heritage Program&#x2019;s cultural and academic activities.
