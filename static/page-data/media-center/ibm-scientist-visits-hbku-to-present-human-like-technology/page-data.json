According to IBM, the cognitive technology can analyze and interpret data to provide personalized recommendations by understanding a user&#x2019;s personality, tone and emotion. Users can create chat bots that can engage in dialogue.<br>\n <br>\n QCRI Executive Director Ahmed Elmagarmid said pioneering platforms like Watson brought artificial intelligence to the masses. &#x201C;Machine learning and big data when combined provide insights previously undreamt of. The infinite possibilities of the IoTs are made even more powerful using transformative tools like Watson,&#x201D; Dr Elmagarmid said.<br>\n &#x201C;We at QCRI are proud to be part of this discussion with IBM Watson.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n During Wednesday&#x2019;s event, QCRI scientists Zoi Kaoudi and Jorge-Arnulfo Quiane-Ruiz also presented a session on their cross-platform machine learning system ML4all. In addition, Ji Lucas and Abdelkader Lattab will presented Forecast and Analytics of Social Media and Traffic (FAST) and Artificial Intelligence for Digital Response (AIDR) technologies. Furthermore, Marco Serafini presented a session on Arabesque, QCRI&#x2019;s system for distributed graph mining.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/161114_IBMWatson_EN_FINAL.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf32","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/ibm-scientist-visits-hbku-to-present-human-like-technology","currSlug":"/media-center/ibm-scientist-visits-hbku-to-present-human-like-technology","title":"IBM Scientist Visits HBKU to Present Human Like Technology"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
