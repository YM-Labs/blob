We also discussed legislation, subsidy, education and financial incentives in order to find the one area that would benefit most from the sustainable building sector. And finally, we looked to the future as well as the important developments for our industry for 2014.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n During the event, the QGBC team delivered a presentation about the Qatar Case Study, Passivhaus &#x2018;Baytna&#x2019; Project. With partners, Kahramaa and Barwa Real Estate, the Passivhaus study seeks to establish if an eco-friendly villa can be a viable building option. <br>\n <br>\n Through the construction and subsequent operation of a Passivhaus villa and a Business As Usual (BAU) villa the project&#x2019;s initial data showed a small increase in capital cost during construction of the Passivhaus compared with a BAU villa, offset against a 50 percent reduction in water and energy consumption and CO2 emissions.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/05%2001%202014_QGBC%20Participation%20at%20EGBC%20Conference%20_%20ENG_%20Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf54","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qgbc-continues-regional-outreach-at-green-building-congress-in-dubai","currSlug":"/media-center/qgbc-continues-regional-outreach-at-green-building-congress-in-dubai","title":"QGBC Continues Regional Outreach at Green Building Congress in Dubai"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
