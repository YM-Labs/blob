Some tips included sending emails instead of faxes whenever possible, reducing company junk mail by cancelling unnecessary print subscriptions, as well as opting for e-tickets and mobile boarding passes when traveling.<br>\n <br>\n QGBC experts estimate that Qatar&#x2019;s population uses a total of 5.4 million sheets of A4 paper a day, which translates into the cutting down of a staggering 540 trees. <br>\n <br>\n Participants in this year&#x2019;s &#x2018;No Paper Day&#x2019; campaign included Qatari Diar Vinci Construction,Eljaish Sports Club, the Habtoor Leighton Group, the Sukaina Secondary School,Intercontinental Doha the City, - Al Khaliji Commercial Bank, Advent Worldwide WLL, Amwaj Catering Services, Gasal Q.S.C, Wyndham Grand Regency Doha, Arabian MEP Contracting, ADCC JV (Aktor Qatar), Movenpick Tower and Suites, Doha, Governor West Bay Suites &amp; Residences, National Petroleum Services Qatar (NPS-Qatar),Ooredoo Qatar, United Development Company (UDC) andCundall Qatar Consulting. <br>\n <br>\n Last year, the 20 organizations which took part in the inaugural campaign subsequently reduced their daily paper consumption by 73 percent by simply adopting the tips suggested by QGBC. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://admin.qf.com.qa:443/app/mmedia/14789\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf7","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/no-paper-day-sees-qatar-residents-tackle-deforestation","currSlug":"/media-center/no-paper-day-sees-qatar-residents-tackle-deforestation","title":"‘No Paper Day’ Sees Qatar Residents Tackle Deforestation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
