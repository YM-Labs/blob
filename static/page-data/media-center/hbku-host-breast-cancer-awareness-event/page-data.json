This is very important because in the earlier stages, breast cancer can be relatively easily treated, but this becomes very difficult towards the end.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Breast cancer is the second highest cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide and among Qatari women, it is the most common cancer with projections of a 60% increase in newly diagnosed cases over the next 6 years.<br>\n <br>\n QBRI&#x2019;s Cancer Center focuses on the disease and seeks to identify new targets for cancer treatment through genomics, proteomics, molecular and cellular biology, integrated with cancer immunobiology and pharmacology.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Karam, whose research at QBRI aims at developing new cancer therapies by using pharmacological and cellular strategies, added: &#x201C;At the booths and our lectures, we explain the major discoveries in cancer, their history, cancer biology and therapeutics. We will also speak about the tools being used in the research and how the researchers of the past have contributed to the treatments of today.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/161018_HBKU%20QBRI%20Breast%20Cancer%20Community%20Outreach_English_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf65","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-host-breast-cancer-awareness-event","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-host-breast-cancer-awareness-event","title":"HBKU Host Breast Cancer Awareness Event"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
