These cement cells were bonded to steel, the type of metal that would be used as a well casing. The cement and steel were subjected to pressures and temperatures in a variety of scenarios, and then the cycles were repeated. The team observed when &#x2014; after how many cycles &#x2014; did the cracks initiate and then propagate. <br>\n <br>\n The result of the experiments is a new testing procedure to ensure the safety of the wells and that groundwater would not be contaminated. The team has filed a patent disclosure on the process and it&#x2019;s now under review.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Dr.%20AmaniResearchNewsReleaseEnglish2014.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf47","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/texas-am-university-at-qatar-research-could-lead-to-safer-greener-wells","currSlug":"/media-center/texas-am-university-at-qatar-research-could-lead-to-safer-greener-wells","title":"Texas A&M University at Qatar Research Could Lead to Safer, Greener Wells"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
