The first edition was an incredible success, introducing several new startups to the local and regional markets. We look forward to assisting the second cohort and helping participants take their tech products to market.&#x201D;. <br>\n <br>\n Throughout the two-week startup boot-camp, 200 entrepreneurs will be put through their paces while working under the guidance of leading Silicon Valley mentors and leveraging an extensive global network of experts.<br>\n <br>\n Alar Kolk, President, EIA, said:&#x201C;The Google founders were from Stanford and the Facebook founders from Harvard. The next game-changing companies will come from students&#x2019; dreams to make the world a better place. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Our mantra for the Arab students is that the greatest danger for most of you is not that your aim is too high, but that it is too low and you reach it. Be the change you want to see in the world. Make the dream true: the next Snapchats, Fortnites, and Spotifys will come from the Arab world.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The AIA&#x2019;s first edition saw the participation of more than 100 aspiring entrepreneurs from Algeria, Lebanon, Oman, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, and Qatar, who went on to launch startups addressing challenges facing the region. <br>\n The deadline to apply is the end of October 2018, with the AIA running from January 2-15, 2019.
