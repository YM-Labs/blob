Often patients do not tell their doctors about the about their use of CAM and doctors also often do not ask specifically about non-medicinal or non-conventional therapies.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The participants in the survey were women who had sought healthcare at primary health centers across Qatar. They hailed from many countries across the Arab World, including Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Palestine, Sudan, Lebanon and Syria.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/141206%20English%20WCMC%20study%20high%20use%20of%20complementary%20medicines%20among%20women.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf59","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcmc-study-high-use-of-complementary-medicines-among-women","currSlug":"/media-center/wcmc-study-high-use-of-complementary-medicines-among-women","title":"WCMC Study: High Use of Complementary Medicines Among Women"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
