From there, QA Sidra&#x2019;s very own kindness movement was born. <br>\n <br>\n Ms. Kim Green, Director, QA Sidra, offered her support and enthusiasm for the student-led Day of Peace and kindness movement. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%202%20(1)-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"519\"><br>\n &#x201C;For our &#x2018;Peace One Day&#x2019; celebrations, Qatar Academy Sidra launched #BeKind. At Qatar Academy Sidra we believe that kindness is in everyone. We want to engage all members of the community through our #BeKind movement, and encourage individuals to show compassion to one another,&#x201D; said Ms. Green.<br>\n <br>\n The International Day of Peace event kicked off with a powerful performance of &#x2018;Asalamu Alykom&#x2019; led by the Arabic department. After a warm welcome by Ms. Green, the Grade 5 students showcased their musical and film talents.<br>\n <br>\n The assembly concluded with secondary school students introducing the #BeKind movement. The students took the initiative to look at areas of the school where they could make the biggest impact in making a positive difference to the school&#x2019;s environment. They explored the idea of QA Sidra creating a slogan, and came up with the &#x2018;Panther Pride&#x2019; greeting. By encouraging the student community to welcome each other with a special greeting, they are helping to promote unity and compassion. <br>\n <br>\n Additionally, to enhance the visual impact of peace, senior students practiced their leadership skills and helped the younger students craft &#x2018;Pinwheels for Peace&#x2019;, referencing the international art and literacy project created in 2005. They helped the primary students look at words and symbols, which, to them, represent kindness. They then took part in a peace parade with parents looking on. <br>\n <br>\n Finally, to commemorate the first International Day of Peace celebration at QA Sidra, the community gathered to take a photograph on the school grounds using their bodies to make the international symbol for peace. The attendees then gathered to view a display of artwork created by parents and faculty about how they view peace and kindness at school and at home.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_QF_PUE_PeaceDayEvent_PressRelease_EN_20170924.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf35","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qa-sidra-celebrates-international-day-of-peace","currSlug":"/media-center/qa-sidra-celebrates-international-day-of-peace","title":"QA Sidra Celebrates International Day of Peace"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
