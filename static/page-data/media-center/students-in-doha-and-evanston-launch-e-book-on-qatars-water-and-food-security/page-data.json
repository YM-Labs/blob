Yet, without desalinization, Qatar possesses a fresh water supply that would last only 48 hours.<br>\n <br>\n Eight graduate students from the Medill School in Evanston traveled to Doha to work with five NU-Q journalism students on the report. Four groups of combined Doha and Evanston students dispersed to locations across Qatar to research and build their reports.<br>\n <br>\n Three of the four groups focused on the production and consumption of tomatoes because of its dependence on large amounts of water and its importance to local cuisine.<br>\n <br>\n NU-Q assistant professor Andrew Mills&#x2014;who led the project with Richard Roth, senior associate dean in Qatar, and professors Bill Handy and Craig Duff at the Evanston campus&#x2014;noted that the project in Qatar has served as an effective stepping stone for US students to understand the Middle East better. He said, &#x201C;There are challenges out there in the world that they wouldn&#x2019;t have thought of when reporting in Chicago or in DC.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://qatar-news.northwestern.edu/food-water-security-book/\">To read the full article on Northwestern&#x2019;s website, please click here.</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf38","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/students-in-doha-and-evanston-launch-e-book-on-qatars-water-and-food-security","currSlug":"/media-center/students-in-doha-and-evanston-launch-e-book-on-qatars-water-and-food-security","title":"Students In Doha And Evanston Launch E-Book On Qatar’s Water And Food Security"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
