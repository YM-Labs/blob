Dr Waqar Azeem told the conference that, going on current global estimates, there are likely to be between 3,000 to 5,000 young people below the age of 18 with autism in Qatar. <br>\n He told the conference that autism assessment input is not just received in the clinical setting, but also more generally through family input, which he described as &#x201C;hugely important&#x201D;.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve always believed that families play a critical role in children&#x2019;s lives, especially when it comes to children with autism. It&#x2019;s of paramount importance to help them develop skills and strategies that will be useful to make their everyday lives easier. Children with autism often need more of a tailor-made approach to be successful in day-to-day functioning. They need to be able to open themselves and build relationships with their families and friends, and we are here to help them do so,&#x201D; said Dr Waqar Azeem, who is also Inaugural Chair of Psychiatry at Sidra.<br>\n <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD-EC-AutismSymposium-PR-ENG-04%2012%202016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17qf44","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qf-hosts-international-specialists-at-autism-symposium","currSlug":"/media-center/qf-hosts-international-specialists-at-autism-symposium","title":"QF Hosts International Specialists at Autism Symposium"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
