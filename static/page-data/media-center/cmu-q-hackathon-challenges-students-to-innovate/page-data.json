Taking place over 24 hours, the event was sponsored by Cisco and the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), part of Hamad Bin Khalifa University. <br>\n <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Hackathon%20Winners-24.jpg\" alt=\"Hackathon Winners.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We have students that come in with all kinds of backgrounds in education and skills; all the way from freshmen to seniors. All the participants are truly great representatives of their universities and their great programs, and Qatar as a whole. As we say here at Carnegie Mellon, their heart is in the work,&#x201D; said Dan Phelps, associate teaching professor and program director of information systems.<br>\n <br>\n Ashraf Aboulnaga, research director at QCRI, said the research institute actively supports events that helped to identify and foster talent in computer science in Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;QCRI has been involved with the hackathon for several years now. We are always looking for talented young computer scientists and have found that CMU-Q produces world class graduates,&#x201D; he said.<br>\n <br>\n Ihab Farhoud, systems engineering manager at Cisco, was also on the judging panel, and liked what he saw. &#x201C;&#x201C;This is the first event of its kind that I have attended in Qatar and I&#x2019;m very thankful to see so much incredible talent,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m really excited, and I would love to see more of this.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The 12 mentors were all CMU-Q graduates, including Raja Fazil Akhtar, a 2017 graduate who now works as a software engineer at Catalyst. Akhtar delivered a keynote speech, saying &#x201C;I participated in one of the Hackathons myself when I was a student, and that was a turning point for me. I became very passionate about developing software that has the ability to solve real life issues. In Hackathon, you spend 24 hours working on a project and all your energy goes into developing this one idea that carries so much potential; it&#x2019;s just a great feeling.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The Best Overall prize went to Abbas Ali, Abdul Rahman Al Fayad, Ahmed Abdeltawab and Mohammed Zakaria; the Best Technical App category went to Ahmed Khan, Keivin Isufaj, Radu Revutchi and Ahmed Saqib; the Best Design went to Sabit Hassan, Aisha Mohamed, Rohith Pillai and Shaden Shaar; and the Rookie Award for the best new team went to Laila Ossama El-Beheiry, Xinyu Ma and Mariam Salman.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Hackathon%20Best%20Tech%20App-17.jpg\" alt=\"Hackathon Best Tech App.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n For more information on programs offered at Carnegie Mellon Qatar, please visit: <a href=\"https://www.qatar.cmu.edu/academics\">https://www.qatar.cmu.edu/academics</a></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf14","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/cmu-q-hackathon-challenges-students-to-innovate","currSlug":"/media-center/cmu-q-hackathon-challenges-students-to-innovate","title":"CMU-Q Hackathon Challenges Students to Innovate"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
