QF R&amp;D is also currently working with other universities interested in joining this program.<br>\n <br>\n Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Chairperson of Qatar Foundation, said, &#x201C;Qatar Foundation believes in the substantial value of a postgraduate education, since it will offer graduates the opportunity to fulfill their personal ambitions and achieve the nation&#x2019;s development goals. We are committed to nurturing lifelong learning and a culture of knowledge among future generations by providing them with a comprehensive education that can open up countless opportunities for creativity and innovation.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Her Highness added, &#x201C;With the launch of the &#x2018;Qatar Foundation Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Energy Sciences&#x2019;, we are keen to foster research and development excellence in relevant subjects like energy sciences, in order to tap into the potential of talented graduates and help them carry out Qatar&#x2019;s aspirations.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The Qatar Energy and Environment Research Institute (QEERI), an integral component of QF R&amp;D, has created a stimulating research environment that offers outstanding graduate students with first-class research training and education. HBKU will provide students with the academic oversight. <br>\n <br>\n Faisal M. Alsuwaidi, President of Research and Development at Qatar Foundation, said, &#x201C;Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s Research &amp; Development division is thrilled to be running this exciting new doctoral program, as it provides yet another example of our commitment and dedication to realizing the Qatar National Vision 2030 and creating a knowledge-based economy. As well as attracting international students, we are encouraging local students to consider this premier program and move closer to becoming a force for positive change in Qatar.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Ahmad Kayvani Fard, Yehia Mohammed Manawi and Deema Almasari are the first three students to be enrolled onto the QF IDPES to pursue their PhDs. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Thomas Zacharia, Executive Vice President of Research and Development at Qatar Foundation, said, &#x201C;We hope this PhD program will be the first of many. The QF IDPES structure is based on the &#x2018;Max Planck&#x2019; model whereby students are employed and supported in a research institute in order to conduct their academic research, in association with an affiliated university. The PhD degree is then awarded by the affiliated university.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The QF IDPES consists of the PhD thesis and an additional PhD curriculum. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://admin.qf.com.qa:443/app/media/8022\">click here</a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf69","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-launches-first-doctoral-program-in-energy-sciences","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-launches-first-doctoral-program-in-energy-sciences","title":"Qatar Foundation Launches First Doctoral Program In Energy Sciences"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
