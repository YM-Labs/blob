Previously only three scholarships were offered, but because of the success of the program and the huge interest from students, four are now provided. This year there were 54 entrants in the competition who came from 18 schools. <br>\n <br>\n The annual Healing Hands Essay Competition is open to Qatari students currently enrolled in high schools.
