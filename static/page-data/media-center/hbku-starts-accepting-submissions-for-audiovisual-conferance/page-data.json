Through papers, panels, and round-table discussions, participants will gain insight into the new AVT landscape. Professionals and academics will engage with peers to learn more about new media, formats, and contexts, alongside innovative approaches to solve challenges. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Amal Mohammed Al-Malki, Dean of CHSS noted: &#x201C;Audiovisual translation has become a major driving force in the world of communication at large. The challenges and opportunities of the rapid changes in society and technology are reason enough to dedicate a whole conference to this theme. By hosting Media for All at TII-HBKU, we wish to make Qatar a hub for the development of audiovisual translation in the Arab world. We encourage scholars, researchers and stakeholders to use this forum as an opportunity to plan ahead towards 2022.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The 7th Media for All International Conference on Audiovisual Translation will create an open meeting space for sharing the challenges and opportunities of the AVT field. It will directly help address Qatar&#x2019;s requirements in developing the tourism and sports industry for the upcoming FIFA World Cup to be hosted by the country in 2022. For the broader Arab region, this conference will enable them to gain valuable insights into novel working and monetizing approaches in AVT, paving the way for the entire region to achieve excellence through specialization.<br>\n <br>\n Submissions to the conference should reflect topics within the global AVT landscape.
