We are delighted with the results from our patient satisfaction survey, which is testament to Sidra&#x2019;s ongoing vigilance and commitment to our patients and thanks to the skills and expertise of our diverse healthcare leaders and teams. We collect and transparently report on patient satisfaction at the Sidra Outpatient Clinic to ensure that we continuously deliver the best quality care and safety for our patients.

It was excellent and I hope they continue to keep up providing such great levels of care and service to patients&#x201D; (about General Surgery), &#x201C;Excellent care - I felt like a VIP!&#x201D; (about Orthopedics) and &#x201C;The service provided was excellent. I have yet to experience better service in other facilities&#x201D; (about the Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic). One patient, was so happy with the care she received from the Obstetrics team that she named her baby Sidra. &#x201C;The team and staff at Sidra were exceptional. I really valued the attention and care that was given to me &#x2013; and it seemed fitting that I name my baby Sidra - a beautiful name which is also mentioned in the Quran.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/2017_02_04%20-%20Sidra%20Patient%20Satisfaction%20Survey%20-%20ENG.pdf\">here</a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf75","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-recognized-for-excellence-in-patient-satisfaction","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-recognized-for-excellence-in-patient-satisfaction","title":"Sidra Recognized for Excellence in Patient Satisfaction"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
