It is currently the only platinum LEED certified student housing complex in the world, earning 12 Platinum LEED certifications in the category of &#x2018;New Construction&#x2019; from the US Green Building Council which also makes it the largest collection of platinum LEED certified buildings in one area in the world<br>\n <br>\n The development comprises two individual male and female complexes with a permeating Islamic motif.
