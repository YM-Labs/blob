DIFI recently conducted many studies and important activities aimed at strengthening the family, and combating discrimination against women.</p>\n<p>“For example, this year we published a study titled ‘Work-Family Balance’ based on quantitative and qualitative data that sought to investigate the challenges confronting working women and the family as a whole. One of the challenges we identified was the lack of achieving a work-family balance, and the negative effects this can have on family members, such as health.</p>\n<p>“We are honored to attend this conference, reaffirming our commitment to support women. Indeed, in March 2019, DIFI organized an event titled ‘Gender-Responsive Social Protection for Adolescent Girls to Enable Aspirations and Reach the SDGs in the Arab Region’ at the 63rd Session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women in New York.”</p>\n<p>DIFI is a global policy and advocacy institute working to advance knowledge on Arab families through research and promote evidence-based polices at a national, regional, and international level. The institute has special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.</p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3NUbMz29iPmB8wdaA4gLXQ","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/difi-attends-73rd-session-of-the-committee-on-the-elimination-of","currSlug":"/media-center/difi-attends-73rd-session-of-the-committee-on-the-elimination-of","title":"DIFI Attends 73rd Session of The Committee on The Elimination of Discrimination Against Women "}}}
