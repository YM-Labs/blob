She called upon participants to harness their creative energies by applying intelligent solutions to these critical challenges that could have a positive impact on the nation&#x2019;s growth and advancement. Local and international delegates were urged to work alongside their peers, and encouraged to focus their attention on pivotal R&amp;D areas.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;This conference is an opportunity to announce our decision to address three priority challenges in our country: energy security, through raising the production of solar energy to one gigawatt by 2020; water security, through promoting the scientific research in the area of water desalination; and cybersecurity, through strengthening information security management in an electronically open and overlapped space,&#x201D; said Her Highness. &#x201C;In addition, we continue to pursue our research in health, particularly in priority sectors for our country, namely diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Her Highness Sheikha Moza reaffirmed Qatar&#x2019;s pledge to support Arab expatriate scientists and to provide the necessary resources to reputable centers across the world so as to advance research expertise locally, regionally, and internationally. <br>\n <br>\n Her Highness said, &#x201C;We believe in the globalization of science, and in sharing, cooperating, and supporting the establishment of scientific research, given that this world is a nation for us all; a world in which science should be devoted to the service of humanity. Given that challenges are global by nature, they require global research solutions through working with international partners who share our beliefs.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n She added, &#x201C;We recognize, as you do, that the tools, capabilities and outputs of scientific research are an intellectual capital. We produce this research together for our mutual benefit, in a way that no one can be entitled to monopolise the means of progress. Here again we reaffirm, as we have done on previous occasions, that there is no other choice other than inculcating solutions together and reaping the fruits, since we are together confronted with different challenges. We will leave no one lagging behind.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Faisal Alsuwaidi, President of Qatar Foundation Research and Development, also underscored the phenomenal value of having such a unique platform for keen scientific minds to explore new technologies and innovative approaches.<br>\n &#x201C;We are building and promoting a research culture that values partnerships across research institutions. We know that our investment in R&amp;D will take time to reduce the broad social and economic impacts articulated in Qatar National Vision 2030. Therefore, our R&amp;D agenda is a long marathon and not a short sprint,&#x201D; said Mr Alsuwaidi. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The country&#x2019;s investment in R&amp;D is significant. We must be good stewards of this investment. We must ensure clear focus, accountability, and efficiency, and we must continue to work with all of you, this country&#x2019;s R&amp;D stakeholders and our partners in academia, government and industry. We must support the highest quality of research addressing our greatest national challenges and make sure that results can help improve people&#x2019;s lives, environment, and economy.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n <img width=\"383\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/0087813002_L-9.jpg\" alt=\"HH Sheikha Moza\"> Mr Alsuwaidi urged delegates to begin working on the identified R&amp;D grand challenges, and explained that the challenges not highlighted this year will remain important and will be addressed through ongoing initiatives such as Qatar National Research Fund grants and in the work of research institutions. <br>\n <br>\n He added, &#x201C;We must move research along the innovation value chain towards commercialization, application, and results. We have already started but results will take some time. The Qatar National Research Strategy 2013 Grand Challenges help us to focus on a few critical areas as we continue to implement the broader plan. To summarize, we have an overarching strategy with QNRS and we are making progress in addressing the wide range of priorities within it.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n During the first panel discussion, leading experts gathered to discuss the challenges and opportunities that Qatar faces, in light of international experience. The insightful session was moderated by Dona Crawford of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the USA, and saw the participation of Dr Thomas Zacharia, the Executive Vice President of Qatar Foundation Research and Development. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Zacharia said, &#x201C;This is an extraordinary opportunity to discuss the challenges, and indeed the opportunities, that face Qatar in research and development. Clearly science is a global enterprise &#x2013; we are indeed building a world-leading research and innovation ecosystem. The three challenges identified give Qatar the opportunity to not only create solutions but to leapfrog technologically and in so doing, create new opportunities for new businesses here in Qatar in our drive towards a knowledge-based and diversified economy.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/24-11-2013_QF-ARC%202013%20Day%20One%20Press%20Release_En_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf5","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/her-highness-sheikha-moza-opens-annual-research-conference-2013","currSlug":"/media-center/her-highness-sheikha-moza-opens-annual-research-conference-2013","title":"Her Highness Sheikha Moza Opens Annual Research Conference 2013"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
