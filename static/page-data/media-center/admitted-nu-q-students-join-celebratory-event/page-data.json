Throughout the night, attendees took part in a series of activities to explore academic, social, and professional opportunities offered by the University. <br>\n <br>\n This year was the most competitive admissions season for NU-Q with more than a 50 percent increase in applications from international candidates &#x2013; representing more than 60 countries. In addition, due to the additional applicants, along with increased selectivity, the percentage of students accepted fell by seven percent.<br>\n <br>\n The Class of 2022 includes a number of students from countries not currently represented at NU-Q, including Brazil, Ethiopia, Ghana, Hungary, Kenya, Mexico, Moldova, Nepal, Russia, Rwanda, Serbia, Taiwan, and Zambia.<br>\n <img alt=\"Photo 2 (2).jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"288\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo%202%20(2)-17.jpg\"><br>\n Alex Schultes, director of admissions spoke to the group and said, &#x201C;Every student joining NU-Q brings their own unique interests, strengths, and background to the university&#x2019;s dynamic student body. We are delighted to see such excitement from the incoming class, most of whom confirmed their enrollment on the night of the event.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Abdelrahman Abed, who has been admitted to the Class of 2022, expressed interest in studying in the Journalism and Strategic Communication Program. &#x201C;I hope to get a degree that will help change the world in a way that is impactful,&#x201D; he said.<br>\n <br>\n Regina Hossfeldt Gonzalez, an aspiring film director, felt that NU-Q would provide her with the academic rigor and practical training she needs to fulfil her dream. &#x201C;I felt inspired by students who have attended Northwestern, and I feel like it&#x2019;s the right place to get a world-class education in that field,&#x201D; she said. <br>\n <br>\n As part of the preview of Northwestern, the students will also attend a lecture on politics and film delivered by NU-Q Professors Scott Curtis and Jocelyn Sage Mitchell on May 1st. The lecture provides the students with a better understanding of what a classroom discussion will be like and offers them an opportunity to engage directly with faculty.
