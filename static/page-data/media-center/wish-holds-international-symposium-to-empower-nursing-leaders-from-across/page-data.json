The first day of the symposium featured a series of practical workshops led by WHO technical staff that provided training to nursing leaders in how to gather and analyze data to better influence policy making at a national level.</p>\n<p>The second day featured a presentation from the WISH 2018 report on nursing and universal health coverage, a discussion on the benefits of membership of the ICN, and an overview of the three-year Nursing Now campaign, which has been created to increase the profile and influence of nurses and midwives globally.</p>\n<p>Ms. Kennedy said: “Everyone deserves the same quality of healthcare, and the publishing last year of the WISH report that explores the vital role that nurses play in delivering universal health coverage was the start of something great that can be built upon, but now it’s up to nursing leaders around the world to move things forward. Every day nurses are saving lives, and this meeting gives nurses the chance to think about how to promote this fact at a national and an international level.”</p>\n<p>Local participant Enaam Al-Naemi, Assistant Executive Director of Nursing for Emergency Medicine at HMC, said: “This meeting has offered me a great opportunity to learn and to network with so many international counterparts. I’m pleased that we are able to share how nurses at HMC are being given opportunities to lead and, as a Qatari, I’m proud that such an important and empowering meeting as this one has been held in Qatar.”</p>\n<p>For further information about WISH, please visit www.wish.org.qa and @WISHQatar on social media.</p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6wSpZPdYHuO7JILFdzDtD0","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-holds-international-symposium-to-empower-nursing-leaders-from-across","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-holds-international-symposium-to-empower-nursing-leaders-from-across","title":"WISH Holds International Symposium To Empower Nursing Leaders From Across Asia, Africa, And The Middle East"}}}
