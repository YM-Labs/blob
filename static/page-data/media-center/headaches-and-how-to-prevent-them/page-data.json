The talk, which was held at the Diplomatic Club, was given by Dr. Basim Uthman, Vice Chair and Professor of Clinical Neurology and Professor of Clinical Neuroscience at Weill Cornell Medicine &#x2013; Qatar (WCM-Q).Dr. Uthman also serves as a consultant in neurology at Hamad Medical Corporation.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Uthman explained that there are basically two types of headaches: secondary headaches, which are caused by high blood pressure, eye disorders, inflammation of the middle ear or sinuses, dental pain, fever, colds, flu and disorders of sugar in the blood; and primary headaches, which can occur independently of any other disease process and may be triggered or exacerbated by psychological or emotional reasons, stress, malfunctioning of some body parts or lifestyle changes.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Uthman said: &#x201C;To prevent primary headaches, you should drink plenty of fluids, particularly water to keep the body hydrated&#x2013; and indeed the brain hydrated and well-cushioned. To relieve the symptoms you can stretch and relax, especially with the lights dimmed and taking a cool bath will help rebalance the circulatory system. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;In the case of a migraine - a type of a primary headache - sufferers should also avoid drinking soft drinks and avoid eating processed meats, pickled items, monosodium glutamate, spices and chocolate, which can all exacerbate headaches. Painkillers like paracetamol can bring relief, but they should not be used on a regular basis &#x2013; it is better to address the triggers or causes of a headache.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The Ask the Expert lectures are interactive public talks that are part of the WCM-Q&#x2019;s Sahtak Awalan &#x2013; Your Health First campaign. They aim to help the public understand health matters and encourage them to make positive changes to their lives.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160511%20English%20Headaches%20and%20how%20to%20prevent%20them.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n &#xA0;</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf98","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/headaches-and-how-to-prevent-them","currSlug":"/media-center/headaches-and-how-to-prevent-them","title":"Headaches and How to Prevent Them"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
