This reflects Kahramaa&#x2019;s concern to mobilize its community outreach efforts to ensure awareness based on innovation and creativity.<br>\n <br>\n Eng. Abdul Aziz Ahmed Al Hammadi, Conservation and Energy Efficiency Department Manager at Kahramaa, said: &#x201C;The Conservation and Energy Efficiency Department seeks to achieve further success and progress through Tarsheed, launched by Kahramaa in 2012. The program aims to raise awareness, encourage technologies, and develop legislation and regulations relating to conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy in Qatar, while considering the socioeconomic growth and environmental dimension to ensure sustainable development and welfare for citizens and residents. A strategy focusing on the program&#x2019;s three pillars: awareness, outreach and community development; laws, regulations and new technologies; and the development of a consumption tariff needs to be expanded.&#x201D; <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QNL%20420A4831-6.jpg\" alt=\"null\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\" width=\"580\" height=\"280\"><br>\n &#x201C;This MoU with Qatar National Library will further help raise awareness about energy conservation through sharing research experiences, leveraging QNL&#x2019;s vast world-class knowledge resources and meeting the program&#x2019;s outreach and community development mandate,&#x201D; Al Hammadi added.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD-EC-QNL_Kahramaa-PR_EN_2017%2001%2009.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"> </span></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf94","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qnl-contributes-childrens-books-to-kahramaas-park","currSlug":"/media-center/qnl-contributes-childrens-books-to-kahramaas-park","title":"QNL Contributes Children’s Books to Kahramaa's Park"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
