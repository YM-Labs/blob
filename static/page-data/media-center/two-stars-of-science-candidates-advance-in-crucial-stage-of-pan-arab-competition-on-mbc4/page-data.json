The Smart Headphones use sensors to monitor and analyze external sounds to stop music automatically when any risk is detected, while the Pool Warning System was designed to alert owners of unintended and possibly dangerous use.<br>\n <img width=\"338\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Red%20Group-9.jpg\" alt=\"Red Group.jpg\"><br>\n The other two projects, Ousama&#x2019;s Car Refueling Tester and Rania&#x2019;s Automatic Zucchini Corer, focused on making existing tasks easier.The Car Refueling Tester monitors the quality of petrol in an automobile&#x2019;s gas tank, and the Automatic Zucchini Corer is an ergonomic machine that greatly reduces the time and strenuous effort spent preparing a common staple of Arab cuisine.<br>\n <br>\n After weeks of tinkering and testing, the young men and women faced an expert jury, who judged based on prototype performance 50 percent), product outlook (30 percent) and the resourcefulness and leadership shown by the candidate (20 percent). In the Stars of Science Engineering round, innovators with the two highest scores moved on in the competition while the candidates with the two lowest scores were eliminated.<br>\n <br>\n On the next <em>Stars of Science</em> episode, to be shown on 25 October at 8:00 KSA time on <em>MBC4</em>, viewers will see four more candidates put their prototypes to the test in an effort to progress to the next stage.<br>\n <br>\n Season 6 of <em>Stars of Science</em> will culminate in a live final hosted by Khaled Al Jumaily &amp; Haneen Al Naqdion <em>MBC4</em> on 15 November at 8:00 PM KSA/ 5:00 PM GMT 2014.Voting from the public and the jury will determine the final outcome.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Two%20SOS%20Candidates%20Advance%20in%20Crucial%20Stage_Eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24qf32","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/two-stars-of-science-candidates-advance-in-crucial-stage-of-pan-arab-competition-on-mbc4","currSlug":"/media-center/two-stars-of-science-candidates-advance-in-crucial-stage-of-pan-arab-competition-on-mbc4","title":"Two Stars of Science Candidates Advance in Crucial Stage of Pan-Arab Competition on MBC4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
