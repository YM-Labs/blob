The students also learned about the laboratory techniques used by Qatar Biobank, including DNA extraction and quantification.<br>\n <br>\n The Summer Experience Program is part of Qatar Biobank&#x2019;s continuous efforts to train future leaders in biobanking. &#x201C;As Qatar Biobank works to create a healthier local population, it&#x2019;s critical that the nation&#x2019;s youth undertake biobanking and genomic studies, so the next generation of healthcare providers can build on the work we&#x2019;ve already done,&#x201D; said Dr. Nahla Afifi, Education and Scientific Manager, and Acting Director of Qatar Biobank, a member of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development. <br>\n <br>\n Through its ongoing collecting of information about the health and lifestyles of local populations and biological samples, Qatar Biobank is creating a path towards personalized medicine that will promote better health for the people of Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n As the largest population-based health initiative ever undertaken in Qatar, Qatar Biobank will make it possible for researchers and scientists to conduct research into the risk factors for some of the greatest health challenges facing Qatar and the region, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. <br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf64","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-biobank-concludes-summer-experience-program","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-biobank-concludes-summer-experience-program","title":"Qatar Biobank Concludes Summer Experience Program"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
