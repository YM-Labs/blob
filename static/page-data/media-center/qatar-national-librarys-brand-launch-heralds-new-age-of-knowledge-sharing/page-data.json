Under the guidance of Qatar Foundation, the library provides free access for students, educators, researchers, and the wider community in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n The QNL building is currently under construction, but many of its resources are already publicly available online, ranging from popular, newly published material to historic and rare documents.<br>\n <br>\n The brand launch coincides with the 20th annual conference and exhibition of the SLA Arabian Gulf Chapter 20th Annual Conference &amp; Exhibition being held in Qatar from 25-27 March 2014.

These treasured antiquities are complemented by artifacts from the early European reception (early prints in Latin from the 15th &#x2013; 17th c.) such as the famous &#x2018;Qanon&#x2019; of Avicenna (Ibn Sina).<br>\n <br>\n In addition to book discussion events and training sessions, QNL is currently offering free online access to its vast collection of online resources including the latest bestsellers, classical works, concerts, top academic journals and documentaries.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/24_03_2014%20Qatar%20National%20Library%20Rebrand%20Press%20Release_English.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15qf34","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-national-librarys-brand-launch-heralds-new-age-of-knowledge-sharing","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-national-librarys-brand-launch-heralds-new-age-of-knowledge-sharing","title":"Qatar National Library’s Brand Launch Heralds New Age of Knowledge Sharing"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
