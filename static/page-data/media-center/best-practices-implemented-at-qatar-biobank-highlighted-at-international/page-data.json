It is platforms like this conference that provide the impetus for local and international experts in the field to converge and initiate the ground-work for addressing our common challenges through a focused agenda. Qatar Biobank and Qatar Genome Programme, having showcased their work to a global audience, will continue to deliver excellence through high-quality, innovative health and biomedical research in Qatar.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Zhengming Chen, Lead Principal Investigator at China Kadoorie Biobank, and one of the keynote speakers of the conference, said: “Qatar Biobank has been one of the major recent developments in ‘big biobanks’ in the last 10 years. This is an exciting era in medical research and technology. These kinds of bigger studies allow for more reliable assessment of risks for a spectrum of diseases.”</p>\n<p>Following the visit, Dr. Andrew Brooks, Chief Operating Officer and Director of Technology Development of RUCDR Infinite Biologics at Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA, said: \"The way we do genomic research and the standard of care is changing. Integrated sample processing, analysis, and functional quality control is critical for success.</p>\n<p>“The model used by Qatar Biobank is an excellent example of how science and technology continue to lead innovation and how we can use the latest technology for sample processing.”</p>\n<p>“It is very impressive how Qatar Biobank has made strategic operational and technology decisions that gives them the most flexibility and opportunities moving forward. They have the infrastructure to expand what they are doing in the future without having to build a new biobank or make significant changes to the way they do things.”
