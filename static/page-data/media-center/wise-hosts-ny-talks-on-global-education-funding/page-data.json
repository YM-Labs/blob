According to a report conducted by the Education Commission, the average annual expenditure on education for low- and middle-income countries is $1.3 trillion, only a third of funding required to achieve SDG 4. <br>\n <br>\n The organizations involved in the New York discussions hosted by WISE included the Education Outcomes Fund (EOF), the International Education Funders Group (IEFG), and members of the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). Funders who participated helped to lead discussions about increasing and improving methods of education financing.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The roundtable discussions organized by WISE enabled conversations to take place on new and better ways of financing education, with the objective of achieving SDG 4,&#x201D; said Zineb Mouhyi, Policy and Partnership Development Officer, WISE.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Hosting these discussions in New York City, a day ahead of WISE@NY, enabled a wide range of global expertise and insight to be applied to this issue, with the aim of identifying potential solutions and pathways for progress, and helping to ensure that children around the world have access to the quality education which improves their lives, strengthens their societies, and equips them with the tools to innovate.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n EOF &#xAC;was established by the Education Commission &#x2013; chaired by former UK Prime Minister the Rt Hon Gordon Brown &#x2013; and the Global Steering Group for Impact Investment, and launched at the 2017 WISE Summit in Doha, after which it co-hosted a roundtable in May 2018 for the WISE@Accra forum. Its involvement in the New York discussions hosted by WISE was designed to build connections with potential funders, and these efforts will be continued at the next WISE international forum, WISE@Paris, in February 2018.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_WISE%20Workshops_PressRelease_EN_20180925.pdf\">here</a><br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf46","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-hosts-ny-talks-on-global-education-funding","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-hosts-ny-talks-on-global-education-funding","title":"WISE Hosts Ny Talks On Global Education Funding"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
