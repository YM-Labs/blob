QGBC will also act as the hub for all Qatar-based companies wishing to become members of ISA and can support them on ensuring their buildings meet sustainability benchmarks. <br>\n <br>\n Qatar Foundation (QF), represented by Health, Safety and Security and Environment (HSSE) Directorate, has become the first organization in Qatar to become an ISA/QGBC member. As a result, the environmental performance of many of QF&#x2019;s buildings can now be evaluated against similar structures in Qatar and the world. Consumption reports will also be on offer, covering direct, indirect and on-site energy, carbon emissions, water consumption and waste generation. <br>\n <br>\n QGBC&#x2019;s ambition is to create a sustainability culture amongst industry professionals through an education and training program. <br>\n <br>\n ISA is a global networking organization, dedicated to improving the sustainability of real estate through benchmarking. Its members include property owners, occupiers and investors who are then able to come together to share best practice in the sustainable management of their property portfolios in order to improve overall performance. <br>\n <br>\n QF and other ISA members can enter their property data in an online tool and evaluate the results any time they choose. In addition, ISA&#x2019;s online tool allows them to identify good and bad performance from within their own portfolios to aid with decision making and possible changes to future ventures. <br>\n <br>\n Members can also monitor improvements in environmental performance over time and against targets, allowing for on-going trend analysis. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/2_%2015_2014_QGBC%20ISA%20Partnership%20PR%20_%20ENGLISH%20_%20FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf74","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-green-building-council-joins-international-sustainability-alliance","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-green-building-council-joins-international-sustainability-alliance","title":"Qatar Green Building Council Joins International Sustainability Alliance"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
