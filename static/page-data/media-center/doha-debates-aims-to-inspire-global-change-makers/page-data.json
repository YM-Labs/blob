Passionate differences of opinion are encouraged in Doha Debates, where a clash of ideas can lead to common ground on today&#x2019;s critical questions &#x2014; live onstage, and in videos, podcasts and social media conversations.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image3-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image3.jpg\" height=\"384\" width=\"640\"><br>\n Speaking at the relaunch of Doha Debates, Her Excellency Sheikha Hind bint Hamad Al Thani said: &#x201C;In a time when soundbites and fake news risk drowning out analysis and discourse, and crucial issues are often viewed through a narrow lens, the importance of enabling and promoting 360-degree thinking is clear. Doha Debates allows such thinking to thrive.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image4-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image4.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"574\"><br>\n &#x201C;Its new concept continues the proud Doha Debates tradition, stretching back to its inception 14 years ago, when it was the only platform of its kind for Arab youth to speak out about the world&#x2019;s most pressing matters and share their perspectives. But it also represents the evolution of this platform &#x2013; and what we stand for as a culture, as a nation, and as Qatar Foundation.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image5-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image5.jpg\" height=\"421\" width=\"640\"><br>\n &#x201C;The majlis format of Doha Debates promotes conversation, rather than competition. It is an equitable setting, not an adversarial one, where every voice is heard, and where issues are addressed and problems solved together. It is a platform rooted in our traditions, and wholly relevant to today. And it is a reflection of values that are at the core of QF, and are woven into the fabric of Education City: a place where respectful dialogue, open-mindedness, and freedom of expression are encouraged.&#x201D; <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image6-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image6.jpg\" height=\"361\" width=\"640\"><br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QF_EC_CD_DohaDebates_PressRelease_EN_20181213.pdf\">here</a>&#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf83","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/doha-debates-aims-to-inspire-global-change-makers","currSlug":"/media-center/doha-debates-aims-to-inspire-global-change-makers","title":"Doha Debates Aims to Inspire Global Change-Makers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
