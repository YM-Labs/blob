During the last visit to QNL, undertaken by my predecessor, the embassy was very impressed with the work of the team and their keen interest in obtaining more books about Thailand. Thus, we have provided more books featuring many aspects of Thai culture to the library. We strongly hope they will enrich the existing collections and complement the goal of human resource development under Qatar&#x2019;s National Vision 2030.&#x201D;<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%203.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3.jpg\" height=\"1656\" width=\"2470\"><br>\n During the visit, HE Mr Soonthorn Chaiyindeepum also visited Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s Visitor Centre where he received a presentation about QF and the work it does to nurture the future leaders of Qatar.After the presentation, the delegation, from an open-air platform, viewed the unique landscape formed by the education and research buildings of Education City. <br>\n <br>\n QNL is committed to QF&#x2019;s vision of unlocking human potential by providing resources to students, researchers, and the wider community of Qatar, as well as preserving the nation&#x2019;s history for future generations through its prized Heritage Collection and international partnerships.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/25%2008%2016%20QNL%20Royal%20Thai%20Embassy%20Visit%20PR_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10qf26","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/modern-books-from-thailand-donated-to-qatar-national-library","currSlug":"/media-center/modern-books-from-thailand-donated-to-qatar-national-library","title":"Modern Books From Thailand Donated To Qatar National Library"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
