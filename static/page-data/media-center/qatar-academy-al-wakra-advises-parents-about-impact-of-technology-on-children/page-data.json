They will still cover topics which are important to parents and important for the school.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/24-05-2014_Qatar%20Academy%20Al%20Wakra%20technology%20workshop%20Post%20PR_English.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf43","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-academy-al-wakra-advises-parents-about-impact-of-technology-on-children","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-academy-al-wakra-advises-parents-about-impact-of-technology-on-children","title":"Qatar Academy Al Wakra Advises Parents about Impact of Technology on Children"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
