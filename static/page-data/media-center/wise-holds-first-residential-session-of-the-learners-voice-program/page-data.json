The Orenda Project is based on the concept of co-creation as a way to increase access to education and works directly with target populations to establish schools in a sustainable, community-driven way. <br>\n <br>\n The Learners&#x2019; Voice Program was established in 2010 as an initiative of WISE with the intention of engaging the perspectives and creative energies of young people in debates around important education issues and challenges.This year&#x2019;s learners, aged 18-25, collectively represent 29 countries, and will benefit from the expertise of the WISE team and global education specialists including faculty from Yale University and Babson College. The Learners&#x2019; Voice Program is supported by its partners Banco Santander through its Universities Global Division.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/03%2001%2016_WISE%20Learners&apos;%20Voice%20Program%20January%202016%20PR_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> click here</strong>.</a><br>\n <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf15","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-holds-first-residential-session-of-the-learners-voice-program","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-holds-first-residential-session-of-the-learners-voice-program","title":"WISEHolds First Residential Session of the Learners’ Voice Program"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
