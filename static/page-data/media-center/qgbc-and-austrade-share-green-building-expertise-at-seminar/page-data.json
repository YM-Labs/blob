Meshal Al Shamari pointed out the similarities between the Australian and Qatari environment as water scarcity and dry arid landscapes are a feature of both countries. He said, &#x201C;Therefore, the two countries can learn much from each other. Issues of sustainability and energy conservation are of increasing importance in Qatar in alignment with the Qatar National Vision 2030. As a result, a whole industry is now beginning to grow here with a focus on conservation, sustainability and renewable energy.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n QGBC Board member and Founder of the Arab Engineering Bureau, Ibrahim M. Jaidah pointed out that Qatar has a history of green building practices that grew out of necessity among local communities dealing with the hot climate. He said, &#x201C;In many ways, early Qatari buildings adopted green practices through strategic site placement, ensuring openings did not face west, the hottest side, the use of alleyways and alcoves to provide naturally shaded environments and with wind towers that captured cool breezes. Today, we can still adopt these basic concepts in the planning stages of construction.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Gerard Seeber, Austrade&#x2019;s Senior Trade Commissioner for MENA, spoke about the strategic partnership between the two countries and their robust economic relationship. Australian companies have been involved in the building of many important structures in Qatar, not least the City Centre Mall, Qatar Foundation and the Kahramaa building, he said.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf47","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qgbc-and-austrade-share-green-building-expertise-at-seminar","currSlug":"/media-center/qgbc-and-austrade-share-green-building-expertise-at-seminar","title":"QGBC and Austrade share green building expertise at seminar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
