Al-Arian, who is currently a professor and director of the Center for Regional Politics at Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University, will be speaking at 6:00 p.m. on March 28 at GU-Q&#x2019;s Education City campus. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/georgetown-logo%20(1).png\" alt=\"georgetown-logo (1).png\" height=\"480\" width=\"480\"><br>\n &#x201C;I&apos;ll be talking about the challenges facing the youth today, particularly in the Middle East, and how they should prepare to face them,&#x201D; said Al-Arian. &#x201C;I hope that the audience will have a better understanding of the major problems facing our world today, and what kind of education and knowledge, as well as tools and skills, they should have to make it a better, and a more equitable and peaceful world.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The lecture is one of the student-run events surrounding this year&#x2019;s MESSA&#x2019;s conference, which focuses on themes of power, influence, and authority in the Middle East. The one-day event, which will be held on March 30, provides undergraduate students with a platform to present and publish their academic research to an audience of peers and experts. <br>\n <br>\n Al-Arian is a prominent Palestinian human rights advocate and community leader. While working as a tenured professor of computer science and engineering at the University of South Florida in 2003, he was pursued by the U.S. government on various charges, resulting in a prolonged legal battle over which he eventually prevailed. After ten years in detention, solitary confinement, and under house arrest, Al-Arian relocated to Turkey in 2015. His case was chronicled in the award winning documentary film U.S.A. vs. Al-Arian. <br>\n <br>\n The scholar has received several civil rights awards and was named &#x201C;the premiere civil rights leader in the U.S.&#x201D; in 2001 by Newsweek for his work to ban the use of secret evidence in American courts. In 2012, he was named, along with Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, as one of three American Muslims in the Encyclopedia of American Dissidents, which included 152 Americans between 1860 and 2010. Al-Arian has authored many publications, including a book on the Arab Spring and collections of poems detailing his time spent inside a federal penitentiary.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5qf57","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/gu-q-student-society-to-host-lecture-by-human-rights-activist","currSlug":"/media-center/gu-q-student-society-to-host-lecture-by-human-rights-activist","title":"GU-Q Student Society to Host Lecture by Human Rights Activist"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
