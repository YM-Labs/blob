If successful in their studies they will graduate in 2019.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Javaid Sheikh, Dean of WCMC-Q, said the White Coat Ceremony was of great significance. &#x201C;The white coat is a universal symbol of science and the art of healing. The coat is a public sign that the wearer has dedicated their life to medicine and is committed to excellence in science and learning. It is a sign that they are compassionate and care for their fellow man. The white coat may, in reality, be just a piece of material but its meaning and significance are so much more.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n WCMC-Q alumna Dr Mashael Abdulrahman Al-Khelaifi, who now works as a pediatric anesthesiologist at Hamad Medical Corporation, delivered the keynote speech.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Al-Khelaifi said: &#x201C;You will develop such camaraderie with the people who are sitting around you, and this bond will help you through many difficult times to come during the course of the next few years. <br>\n <br>\n You will spend more time with them than your own families. You will laugh together, you will cry together, and you will celebrate your successes together. I speak from experience, and I can tell you that I have not only gained an excellent medical education from this school, but I have also gained brothers and sisters who will always have a special place in my heart.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/150829%20English%20Future%20Doctors%20Receive%20First%20Stethoscope.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf76","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/future-doctors-receive-first-stethoscope","currSlug":"/media-center/future-doctors-receive-first-stethoscope","title":"Future Doctors Receive First Stethoscope"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
