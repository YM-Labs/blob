Undoubtedly they are a positive driver for change and much has been accomplished. However, the question remains whether they really do act as a driver of change for the majority of the industry. Moreover, do they really work in improving the sustainability of the existing building stock? Is regulation the only answer or are there other alternatives, especially for the existing building stock where retrospective legislation would be untenable?&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Experts expressed belief that, with increased pressure on natural resources pushing the production of CO2 emission per capita in the region to one of the highest in the world, it has become imperative to weigh the benefits of new systems and to develop an integrated approach.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/29%2009%202013_QGBC%20_CO2%20ASSESSMENT_Eng_Dr7.pdf\">click here</a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf79","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-green-building-council-seminar-evaluates-effectiveness-of-building-assessment-systems","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-green-building-council-seminar-evaluates-effectiveness-of-building-assessment-systems","title":"Qatar Green Building Council Seminar Evaluates Effectiveness Of Building Assessment Systems"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
