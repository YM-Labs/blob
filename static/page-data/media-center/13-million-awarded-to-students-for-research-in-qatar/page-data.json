The program gives undergraduate students the opportunity to acquire invaluable &#x2018;hands-on&#x2019; experience by participating in innovative research under the guidance of their respective faculty.Each proposal was evaluated under strict criteria by three independent peer reviewers. <br>\n <br>\n Proposals awarded by QNRF were submitted by students from Qatar University, Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar, Ahmed Bin Mohamed Military College in Qatar, Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar, and Northwestern University in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The latest cycle saw grants awarded to 145 students, 44 of whom are Qatari students,&#x201D; said Sunitha Shyam, Training Programs Manager at QNRF. &#x201C;This is really encouraging and I am particularly pleased to see such a high number of female Qatari students participate in UREP. Supporting young women in Qatar to further develop skills in science and research is a key area for QNRF so we are extremely happy that 27 Qatari females participated,&#x201D; she added.<br>\n <br>\n The students will carry out research on a wide spectrum of topics that are of benefit to Qatar.The research projects include a study of biodiversity in date palms from different regions in Qatar, building a hybrid-renewal energy generation system for eco-friendly buildings in Qatar, improving Doha&#x2019;s residential neighborhood by promoting healthy communities, a study to engage and empower Qatari women, and examining the transition of Doha&#x2019;s Fareej Al Asmakh to a living heritage district. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/20_01_14%20QNRF_UREP%2015%20cycle%20results_PR_ENGLISH_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf16","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/13-million-awarded-to-students-for-research-in-qatar","currSlug":"/media-center/13-million-awarded-to-students-for-research-in-qatar","title":"$1.3 Million Awarded To Students For Research In Qatar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
