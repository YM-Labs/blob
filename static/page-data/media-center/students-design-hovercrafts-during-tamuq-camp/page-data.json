The program included science activities, hands-on engineering projects and contests to challenge students&#x2019; math and science skills. Students learned about science concepts, design, teamwork and creativity through interactive activities conducted in Texas A&amp;M at Qatar&#x2019;s STEM Hub, funded by Qatar National Research Fund.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/344A0663-edited%20(1)-17.jpg\" alt=\"344A0663-edited (1).jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"453\"><br>\n Engineering Explorers is the latest in a series of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) workshops offered by Texas A&amp;M at Qatar. The workshops are designed to interest bright, young students in pursuing engineering and science career paths to develop the scientific workforce Qatar needs to reach the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030. <br>\n <br>\n Built around the engineering design and fabrication processes, Engineering Explorers teaches students how to solve problems systematically and understand how to implement STEM basics into their future science projects. With a theme of using technology for coastal cleanup, the students designed a battery-powered hovercraft capable of cleaning the coastline offshore and onshore. <br>\n <br>\n The students researched hovercraft theory and ways in which components of the hovercraft contribute to how it works. They then implemented their designs using 3D printing technology. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/FR5R1619%20(1)-17.jpg\" alt=\"FR5R1619 (1).jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n The workshop ended with a competition between the fabricated hovercrafts to evaluate design, speed, payload and reliability in coastal cleanup. &#x201C;The Mechanics&#x201D; comprising students from Qatar Academy Sidra and Dukhan English School won the first prize for their design, exceptional teamwork and outstanding construction.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/English_PDF.pdf\">here</a></strong>.</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf31","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/students-design-hovercrafts-during-tamuq-camp","currSlug":"/media-center/students-design-hovercrafts-during-tamuq-camp","title":"Students Design Hovercrafts During TAMUQ Camp"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
