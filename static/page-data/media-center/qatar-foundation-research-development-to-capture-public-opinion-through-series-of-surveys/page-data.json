Therefore, QF R&amp;D, one of the main pillars of Qatar Foundation (QF), has commissioned Qatar University Social &amp; Economic Survey Research Institute (SESRI) to conduct the surveys as part of the &#x2018;Baseline Measurement Survey on General Public Awareness, Appreciation and Support for Research&#x2019; project. <br>\n <br>\n Due to commence in November, QF R&amp;D&#x2019;s research project supports QF&#x2019;s on-going mission to cultivate in Qatar a culture of active citizenship, life-long learning and interest in research. <br>\n <br>\n A workshop was held between QF R&amp;D and SESRI in order to formalize objectives, design and methods ahead of the launch of the surveys. Participants discussed the need to identify a national representative measure of perceptions, knowledge, and support for R&amp;D in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n SESRI will begin reaching out to Qatari nationals and white-collar expatriates in November 2015; seeking their opinions with regard to expectations and perceived benefits of R&amp;D in Qatar. This brief and confidential survey will be conducted by telephone from SESRI&#x2019;s calling centre, targeting a statistically drawn sample of the resident population. Additional electronic surveys will be conducted with members of academia, public and private sectors, in addition to the media. <br>\n <br>\n The results of these surveys are expected to provide a comprehensive view of the R&amp;D landscape in Qatar, which in turn, will assist in identifying avenues for increasing awareness and support among the different target groups, and constructing a context-specific model of engagement with research, science, and technology. The survey results will also serve as the baseline for monitoring public support over time.&#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf93","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-research-development-to-capture-public-opinion-through-series-of-surveys","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-research-development-to-capture-public-opinion-through-series-of-surveys","title":"Qatar Foundation Research & Development to Capture Public Opinion Through Series of Surveys"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
