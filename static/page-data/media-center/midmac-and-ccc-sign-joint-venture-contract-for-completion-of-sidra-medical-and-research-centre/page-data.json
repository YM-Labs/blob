(Offshore) (CCC).<br>\n <br>\n MIDMAC is one of Qatar&#x2019;s largest contracting organizations, while CCC is one of the biggest and most well-regarded engineering and construction companies in the Middle East region. Both companies have proven track records in delivering vast and challenging projects. <br>\n <br>\n The new agreement follows the recent termination of the contract awarded to the OHL Internacional / Contrack (Cyprus) Ltd. Joint Venture in 2008 for the design and construction of Sidra project.<br>\n <br>\n The MIDMAC/CCC Joint Venture expects to commence its operations imminently, and hopes to employ a number of sub-contractors previously engaged by the OHL/Contrack Joint Venture, thereby preserving the knowledge of the Sidra facilities and expertise which has been accumulated thus far.<br>\n <br>\n Sidra, located at Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s campus, Doha, is of considerable strategic importance for the people of Qatar, as the nation continues its journey towards the realization of a knowledge economy.
