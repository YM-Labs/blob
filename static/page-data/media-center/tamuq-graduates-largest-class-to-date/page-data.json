Of those degrees, 56 were awarded to Qatari graduates. In addition, TAMUQ awarded 14 Master of Science and Master of Engineering degrees in chemical engineering. <br>\n <br>\n TAMUQ Dean, Dr. C&#xE9;sar O. Malav&#xE9;, presided over the ceremony &#x2014; his first since he joined the branch campus in July 2016. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Malave-17.jpg\" alt=\"Malave.jpg\" width=\"639\" height=\"426\"><br>\n Malav&#xE9; said, &#x201C;It is an honor to serve as dean for Texas A&amp;M at Qatar&#x2019;s 10th commencement ceremony. A dream that started with 29 students in the fall 2003 has now achieved a major milestone. All the credit goes to the faculty and staff who have dedicated their professional lives to the development of these amazing leaders. What you see today are fearless engineering leaders that will transform our world: Aggie engineers who will work hard to tackle the challenges of the 21st century and make our world a better place for all.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n J. Todd Creeger, president of ConocoPhillips Qatar and a Class of 1986 graduate of Texas A&amp;M University, was the night&#x2019;s guest speaker.
