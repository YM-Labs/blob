ISMRM promotes innovation, development and application of magnetic resonance techniques, an imaging technique used in radiology to investigate the anatomy and function of the body, in medicine and biology throughout the world. Seven ground-breaking research abstracts, in which Sidra researchers made significant contributions, were accepted for discussion and poster presentations. <br>\n <br>\n In addition, Dr Mohammad Haris, Principal Investigator in Sidra&#x2019;s Research Division, delivered a talk on his new MRI methodology to image the proteases enzyme activity in cancerous tissues. This is the first time when the cancerous protease activity can be monitored in vivo at high resolution. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Since the malignancy and aggressiveness of cancer is highly correlated with the protease enzymes expression, it is possible to image and quantify the aggressiveness of the cancerous tissue in in vivo using this new imaging method,&#x201D; said Dr Haris. &#x201C;Such technique will provide clinicians advance information about the tumor aggressiveness and will help in better clinical management of patients.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The ultimate goal is to transfer these new cutting-edge MR techniques to clinical setup and improve the health of the population. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story on Sidra&apos;s website, please <a href=\"http://www.sidra.org/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri-research-development-at-sidra-medical-and-research-center/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf91","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri-research-development-at-sidra-medical-and-research-center","currSlug":"/media-center/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri-research-development-at-sidra-medical-and-research-center","title":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Research Development at Sidra Medical and Research Center"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
