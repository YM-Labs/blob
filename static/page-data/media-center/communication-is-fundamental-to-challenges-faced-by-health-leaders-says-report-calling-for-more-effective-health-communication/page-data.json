Seemingly simple things like taking a full course of medicine, managing a healthy diet, maternal health awareness and cancer screening can all prevent the need for health services further down the line - saving both lives and money.<br>\n <br>\n Communicating Complex Health Messages (CCHM) was pinpointed as an area of research by WISH at a timely and crucial crossroads in health care and communication &#x2013; the rate at which we can access and spread information is increasing, our trust in sources is decreasing, competing views are common, and the media landscape is increasingly fragmented. To encourage global focus on this crucial issue WISH presented a report led by L. Suzanne Suggs, Associate Professor at Universit&#xE0; della Svizzera italiana, as Chair of the CCHM Forum. <br>\n <br>\n Professor The Lord Darzi of Denham, Executive Chair of WISH, said: &#x201C;Communicating such messages effectively is not an easy task. While the health challenges we face are great, we have more tools and more knowledge at our fingertips than ever before. Today&#x2019;s report sets out a framework to aid policymakers in prioritizing this often over-looked healthcare issue and to guide them in designing and delivering simple messages in an increasingly complex world. Our hope is that policymakers will adopt and implement the proposed communications framework as a result of this unique and timely report.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Watch Suzanne Suggs introduce her research- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONguMEUb-Mw\"><strong>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONguMEUb-Mw</strong></a>. <br>\n <br>\n To download the reports, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wish.org.qa\"><strong>www.wish.org.qa</strong></a>.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on WISH&#x2019;s website, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wish-qatar.org/media-center/press-release-details?item=140&amp;backArt=71\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf28","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/communication-is-fundamental-to-challenges-faced-by-health-leaders-says-report-calling-for-more-effective-health-communication","currSlug":"/media-center/communication-is-fundamental-to-challenges-faced-by-health-leaders-says-report-calling-for-more-effective-health-communication","title":"Communication is Fundamental to Challenges Faced by Health Leaders says Report Calling for More Effective Health Communication"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
