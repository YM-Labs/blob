Innovation gets accelerated when those involved in the process build connections with others that are not traditionally seen as collaborators in their field.&#x201D; <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/HBKU_Sidhu_workshop_DrHasnah_KhalidAlAli_2-24.jpg\" alt=\"HBKU_Sidhu_workshop_DrHasnah_KhalidAlAli_2.jpg\" width=\"560\" height=\"300\"><br>\n Dr. Ahmad M.
