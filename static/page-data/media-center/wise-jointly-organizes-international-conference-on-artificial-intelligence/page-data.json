The discussion brought to light the inequities in communities struggling to keep up with changing technology, and the factors that inhibit their progress. </p>\n<p>Stavros Yiannouka, CEO of WISE, said: “We are in the early stages of identifying how technology can work with education, and where we can nudge the technology to create a more promising future.” </p>\n<p>The Curiosity Conference also featured a variety of panels, workshops, and discussions about designing ethical and inclusive technologies, education in the AI era, rethinking learning systems, and reskilling for an AI future. And Steve Jurvetson, Managing Director and Founder of Future Ventures, shared ideas from SpaceX, a private American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation company, including plans to launch broadband worldwide to help emerging communities significantly improve development and quality education. </p>\n<p>As part of the trip to the US, and ahead of the Curiosity Conference, WISE participated in the 25th International Economic Forum of the Americas in Miami to facilitate efforts between local Qatari and US strategic partnerships. </p>\n<p>WISE also attended the ASU GSV – the world’s leading education and workforce summit – in San Diego where the theme of the summit was ‘Bending the arc of human potential’, and concluded the tour at the Comparative &#x26; International Education Society (CIES) conference in San Francisco, where WISE research on secondary education in West Africa was presented.</p>\n<p>The US tour provided valuable insight into educational innovations coming out of the Silicon Valley, as well as other innovation hubs in the country. These topics will contribute to discussions at this year’s WISE Summit in Doha, taking place from November 19-21. </p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1EZR9snxqcOeG8wB5dYKDm","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-jointly-organizes-international-conference-on-artificial-intelligence","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-jointly-organizes-international-conference-on-artificial-intelligence","title":"WISE Jointly Organizes International Conference On Artificial Intelligence And Education"}}}
