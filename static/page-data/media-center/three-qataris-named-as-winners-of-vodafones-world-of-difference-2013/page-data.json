This shows the Qatari community&#x2019;s increasing motivation to get involved and play an active role in the development of Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n Three Qatari winners were selected out of the 150 applicants due to their passion and selfless dedication to bring about positive change in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n <ul>\n <li>&#xA0; Mr Mohammed Al-Kuwari:Mr Al Kuwari&#x2019;s idea is to develop assistive informatics solution using RFID and mobile technology to help blind individuals to live more independently. The technology will enable people with visual impairment to be able to identify objects around them at home or at the office easily, facilitating their navigation through spaces around them more easily. Mr Al Kuwari named his project &#x2019;The Vodafone Eye&#x2018; to thank Vodafone for its support. Mr Al Kuwari&#x2019;s passion for science started from an early age, and he has developed his skills to become the first Qatari inventor, inventing a number of inventions making him the first Qatari to obtain scientific patent rights.&#xA0;</li>\n </ul>\n <br>\n <ul>\n <li>Mrs Salwa Al Kuwari: Mrs Al Kuwari is the Principal at Al Kawthar female high school. In 2009 she started a program in the school when she noticed the need for a mind-set change among the youth around the way they view their role in society and a need for a strong sense of self-awareness to unlock the youth&apos;s potential and equip them with the right ethics and personal and professional skills. She launched the &#x2019;You Shine&#x2018; program in 2009 at her school, and three years later the program expanded to 19 Qatari boys and girls schools, both middle and high schools. The program reached more than 7,000 students and their parents, involving many influential role models in Qatari society. Vodafone will support her program this year and help her expand it even further.</li>\n </ul>\n <br>\n <ul>\n <li>Mr Mohammed Al Matwi: Mr Al Matwi is a Business Administration student in Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar who started a theatrical/drama flash mob campaign at his university that aims to raise awareness about road safety among Qatari youth. This came about after seeing the number of lives lost increase especially among young people in Qatar over the last three years. His campaign, titled &#x2019;Ahmeek-Protect You&#x2018;, captured the hearts of students at Qatar Foundation with its creativity and engaging scenes. Vodafone will support him in expanding his awareness campaign in Qatar to reach the wider community.</li>\n </ul>\n <br>\n <br>\n Vodafone will be regularly communicating on the winners&#x2019; projects and progress throughout the year.<br>\n <br>\n &apos;World of Difference&apos; is an initiative under Vodafone&#x2019;s corporate social responsibility programme- Vodafone Better World. This unique flagship initiative is a first of its kind in Qatar in which Vodafone gives people the opportunity to receive funding for 12 months to undertake projects to help the community in Qatar. The projects can focus on any area, cause or social issue as long as it meets a local need and is 100% non-profit.</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf93","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/three-qataris-named-as-winners-of-vodafones-world-of-difference-2013","currSlug":"/media-center/three-qataris-named-as-winners-of-vodafones-world-of-difference-2013","title":"Three Qataris Named as Winners of Vodafone’s World of Difference2013"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
