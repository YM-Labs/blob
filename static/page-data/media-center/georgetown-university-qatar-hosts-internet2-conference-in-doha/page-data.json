An NREN, or a National Research and Education Network, is a specialized internet service provider supporting the technology needs of the research and education communities within countries, and serves as a building block of this non-commercial Internet platform. NRENs are typically where new Internet protocols and architectures are invented and tested before introduction into the Public Internet.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Right now, connectivity is very expensive - it&#x2019;s cheaper to connect to London than between the MENA countries - which means that collaboration between institutions is limited. We&#x2019;re hoping to one day optimize platforms such as open exchange points to dramatically improve connectivity in the region,&#x201D; said Johnathon Chapman, Chief Information Officer at GU-Q, and chair of the Middle East chapter of the Internet2 Emerging NRENs Middle East Special Interest Group.<br>\n <br>\n <strong>To read the full article on Georgetown&#x2019;s website, please <a href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/416299.html#.UlKzhFN6jto\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a></strong><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5qf8","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/georgetown-university-qatar-hosts-internet2-conference-in-doha","currSlug":"/media-center/georgetown-university-qatar-hosts-internet2-conference-in-doha","title":"Georgetown University Qatar Hosts Internet2 Conference in Doha"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
