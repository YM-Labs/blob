The show provides valuable support and mentorship to participants through a network of experienced engineers, designers and business leaders.<br>\n <br>\n FitTastic, developed with portable motion tracking sensors and an interactive smartphone application, allows users to go beyond simply recording their workout progress with features such as live games, challenges, rewards, and real-time online multiplayer competitions.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;People like to be challenged. This is why we enjoy games, we want to compete with ourselves and others and be our best at something. FitTastic merges this concept with fitness to get people off the couch and become more active,&#x201D; explained Nadim. <br>\n <br>\n Nadim began his career at a local caf&#xE9; in Qatar, striving to support his bid to enroll at one of Qatar&apos;s various world-class universities. In 2008, GU-Q recognized his potential and offered him a scholarship to begin his academic career majoring in International Politics.<br>\n <br>\n Commenting on how studying at GU-Q has enabled him to succeed, Nadim said: &quot;Georgetown offers much more than a high caliber academic program. In addition to learning about global issues and world affairs, it instills within you the desire to be a productive member of your community and to contribute to the development of society. In the spirit of the GU ethos of &#x2018;men and women for others&apos;, I found a way to utilize my passion for fitness, health, and technology in a way to make a meaningful impact to an important regional issue.&quot;<br>\n <br>\n Currently, Nadim works at Doha-based Silatech, a social initiative dedicated to addressing the massive youth unemployment challenge in the region. Nadim intends to continue developing FitTastic, an invention which he says has the potential to revolutionize the fitness culture in the Arab world.<br>\n </div>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf78","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/georgetown-alumnus-utilizes-technology-to-fight-obesity","currSlug":"/media-center/georgetown-alumnus-utilizes-technology-to-fight-obesity","title":"Georgetown Alumnus Utilizes Technology to Fight Obesity"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
