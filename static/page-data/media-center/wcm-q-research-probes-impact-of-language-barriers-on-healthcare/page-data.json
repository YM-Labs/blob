Hindi and Urdu speakers reported encountering language barriers more than Arabic and English speakers. Patients reported using informal communication strategies, such as communicating through untrained nurses or family members, non-verbal communication, and mixing languages. <br>\n <br>\n The research was carried out in partnership with Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) and the University of Michigan and now been published in the highly regarded Journal of Health Communication in a paper titled &#x2018;Patient Perspectives on Language Discordance During Healthcare Visits: Findings From the Extremely High-Density Multicultural State of Qatar&#x2019;. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Ravinder Mamtani, Professor of Healthcare Policy and Research, Professor of Integrative Medicine, Senior Associate Dean for Population Health, Capacity Building and Student Affairs: &#x201C;By learning to communicate with one another as effectively as possible we can maximize healthcare outcomes for all. We are very grateful to our associates at HMC for their extremely supportive attitude to this important piece of research.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Huda Abdelrahim, a Senior Specialist of Cultural Competence in Healthcare in WCM-Q&#x2019;s Institute for Population Health, co-principal investigator and the lead author of the paper said: &#x201C;This project is a great example of collaborative efforts to investigate cross-cultural issues in healthcare. More studies like this can help inform policies to eliminate healthcare disparities, ensure patient safety and augment healthcare outcomes for diverse populations.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Michael D. Fetters, The Principal investigator, Professor and Co-Director of Mixed Methods Research and Scholarship Program at the University of Michigan said: &#x201C;In this paper we wanted to identify how language barriers diminish access to healthcare from the perspectives of patients themselves, as this information can be used to develop strategies to transcend linguistic differences and enhance healthcare access for all.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170606%20Arabic%20WCM-Q%20research%20probes%20impact%20of%20language%20barriers%20on%20healthcare.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf22","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-research-probes-impact-of-language-barriers-on-healthcare","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-research-probes-impact-of-language-barriers-on-healthcare","title":"WCM-Q Research Probes Impact of Language Barriers on Healthcare"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
