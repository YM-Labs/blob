And each year, as the school&#x2019;s student body continues to grow so does the variety and extent of the projects. <br>\n <br>\n <img width=\"400\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/1957901_703893036318242_1017593449_o-9.jpg\" alt=\"1957901_703893036318242_1017593449_o.jpg\"> With over a hundred students now on their final year in the Middle Years Programme (MYP), the projects have covered &#x201C;fashion to fitness, writing to woodwork, drawing to songwriting,&#x201D; shares Grade 10 student Aaser Sadek. &#x201C;We have a wide variety of unique and innovative projects, intended to demonstrate the skills we have acquired throughout our MYP years&#x2019;.<br>\n <br>\n According to MYP Coordinator Angelika Kuster the personal project exhibition always happen in the final year of the program. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s really the culmination of the students&#x2019; learning over the five MYP years. It is a celebration of what they have learned, how can they put in their learning into a project that they have chosen; therefore, it is a combination of the research they need to do to achieve a goal they have set&#x201D;.<br>\n <br>\n In this age of instant information that is accessible from virtually anywhere, emphasis is given on the quality of research and resources. <br>\n <br>\n Kuster explains that QA focuses on teaching the students the skill of evaluating sources and information. &#x201C;We try to encourage the students to not just go to Google and put in a search term and go to the first website that comes up. Instead we work with them in really critically looking at a particular piece of information and then taking that research and looking at how to apply that first to their projects and second how to express that process in their report&#x201D;.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/MYP%20Personal%20Project%20Exhibition.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf36","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qas-myp-students-showcase-over-100-personal-projects-in-exhibition","currSlug":"/media-center/qas-myp-students-showcase-over-100-personal-projects-in-exhibition","title":"QA’s MYP Students Showcase Over 100 Personal Projects in Exhibition"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
