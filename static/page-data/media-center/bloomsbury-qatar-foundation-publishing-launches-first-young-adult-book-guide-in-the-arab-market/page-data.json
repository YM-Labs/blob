Topics cover anything from Amal in Australia who decides to wear the hijab in high school although she is desperate to fit in, to supermom whose superpowers enable her to hide in her son&#x2019;s pocket as he goes to school to face his bullies. <br>\n <br>\n The guide is edited by Amira Abed and features essays by leading Arab authors Abdul Aziz Al Seoud and Fatima Sharafeddine. They will be handed out free of charge at the Doha International Book Fair taking place from 7 &#x2013; 17 January at Qatar National Convention Centre.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/07%2001%202015_BQFP%20launch%20of%20Book%20Guide%20Post%20PR%20En.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2qf34","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/bloomsbury-qatar-foundation-publishing-launches-first-young-adult-book-guide-in-the-arab-market","currSlug":"/media-center/bloomsbury-qatar-foundation-publishing-launches-first-young-adult-book-guide-in-the-arab-market","title":"Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Publishing Launches First Young Adult Book Guide in the Arab Market"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
