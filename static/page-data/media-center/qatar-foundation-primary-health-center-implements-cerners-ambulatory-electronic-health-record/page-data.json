We are pleased with the support Cerner has provided us to deliver this successful implementation that meets our vision to be a world-class patient-centered and integrated primary health care center in Qatar.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The Cerner&#xAE; solutions implemented have automated physician and nursing workflows, along with laboratory, dental and administrative services.
