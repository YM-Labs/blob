Following the conclusion of the Forum, a number of the Forum&#x2019;s student delegates will present their findings to the United Nations 13th Conference on Crime and Criminal Justice, which is being held in Doha next week.<br>\n <img width=\"640\" height=\"406\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%202-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2.jpg\"><br>\n The three-day Youth Forum has been jointly organized by Qatar Foundation (QF), the Organising Committee of the United Nations 13th Conference on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). With 120 student delegates of different nationalities and backgrounds taking part, the Doha Youth Forum presents a key opportunity for them to work together and develop creative solutions to global issues on crime. <br>\n <img width=\"640\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%204-17.jpg\" alt=\"Doha Youth Forum on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice\"><br>\n &#x201C;This Forum is unique as it&#x2019;s the first time I have seen young Qataris participating in events usually designed for VIPs,&#x201D; said Mohammed Saad Al-Amine, a 17-year-old Qatari student. &#x201C;I think this might encourage some of us to enter the diplomatic service, as participating at this age will help us prepare to be future pioneers. Our school chose a number of students to participate in this Forum, and I was one of the students who wished to take part.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Another Qatari student, 18-year-old Saqr Abdullah Al-Muraikhi, said: &#x201C;The youth is the future of this country, so it is important that they can express their opinions and suggest solutions to problems. A lot of crime now happens in cyberspace, and young people are well-positioned to combat it as they are very knowledgeable about the Internet. Crime can also be prevented by the Qatari youth educating others and being advocates of what is right and wrong.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/07-04-2015%20Doha%20Youth%20Forum%20Student%20Perspective%20PR%20ENG.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf97","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/doha-youth-forum-on-crime-prevention-and-criminal-justice-provides-key-platform-for-student-voices-to-be-heard","currSlug":"/media-center/doha-youth-forum-on-crime-prevention-and-criminal-justice-provides-key-platform-for-student-voices-to-be-heard","title":"Doha Youth Forum on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Provides Key Platform for Student Voices to be Heard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
