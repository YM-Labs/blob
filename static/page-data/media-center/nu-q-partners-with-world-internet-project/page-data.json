Findings from the NU-Q study will be shared with WIP, which has compiled research from 37 countries to date, and be made publicly available. <br>\n <br>\n The initiative makes Qatar an important player in the ground-breaking research related to new media, according to NU-Q dean and CEO Everette Dennis. WIP partner countries serve as a base -via local universities and research institutes -for conducting detailed research, generating a wealth of publications and holding annual conferences that examine the impact of new technologies. <br>\n <br>\n Results of the survey are expected in April, Dr. Dennis said, and will offer insight on how the use of the Internet is changing people&apos;s lives in the Arab world, from media use to governance and business. <br>\n <br>\n The findings of the five-continent collaboration cover 42 topics, including the Internet and social connections, politics and the Internet, online entertainment and personal privacy. <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf41","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-partners-with-world-internet-project","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-partners-with-world-internet-project","title":"NU-Q partners with World Internet Project"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
