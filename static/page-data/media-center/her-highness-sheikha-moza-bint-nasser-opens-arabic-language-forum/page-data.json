The initiative promotes the teaching and learning of Arabic, and, therefore, supports QF&#x2019;s mission to develop a knowledge-based society that upholds and promotes the region&#x2019;s heritage and culture. <br>\n <br>\n In her opening remarks, Her Highness Sheikha Moza said, &#x201C;Our failure to effectively use modern communication techniques has led to an inability to preserve the Arabic language. It is unfortunate that a few decades ago the Arabic language was more prevalent in children than it is today.&#x201D;<br>\n <img width=\"1328\" height=\"885\" alt=\"null\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/0103416004_M.jpg\"><br>\n Her Highness highlighted some of the challenges facing the Arabic language, some of which can be attributed to families, weak school curriculums, television programmes, and globalisation. &#x201C;If we want to save our identity we have no choice but to advance ourselves and enhance the Arabic Language in order to adjust with the contemporary era.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Proposing several solutions, Her Highness concluded by calling for the unification of intellectual scholars, legislatures, cultural figures, and the media to protect the Arabic language, explaining the need for it to be simplified in schools systems and encouraging television programmes to adopt formal Arabic.<br>\n <img width=\"1328\" height=\"885\" alt=\"0103416005_M.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/0103416005_M.jpg\"><br>\n Exploring development strategies, the first day of the Forum featured a variety of lectures and workshops. The panels included &#x2018;The Development of Arabic Language Skills for Children&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Effects of Children&#x2019;s Exposure to Current Arabic Media Content&#x2019;.<br>\n <br>\n Alongside the Forum, the QNCC is also hosting an interactive Arabic language exhibition for children. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/01-20-2016%20WORAL%20Arabic%20Language%20Forum_Day1_QF_%20En.pdf\"><strong> click here</strong></a>.<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:\n &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:\n EN-US\"><br>\n </span></span></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8qf98","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/her-highness-sheikha-moza-bint-nasser-opens-arabic-language-forum","currSlug":"/media-center/her-highness-sheikha-moza-bint-nasser-opens-arabic-language-forum","title":"Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser Opens Arabic Language Forum"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
