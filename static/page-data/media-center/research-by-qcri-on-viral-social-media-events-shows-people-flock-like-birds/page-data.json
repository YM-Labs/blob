As the time between tweets on a topic decreased and the elements of them became increasingly aligned, some users were leading as others started to adopt a similar opinion. However, at some point, the alignment was complete with no clear leader, and leaders became indistinguishable from followers.<br>\n <br>\n The researchers found there were early warning signs that could detect when a transition was about to take place in the build-up of collective attention.<br>\n <br>\n They discovered that as the pace of tweeting accelerated, the complexity of the information exchange increased. The research was published in the journal, Science Advances, on Friday.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160406_QCRI%20Dr%20%20Javier%20Research_Final_English%20(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br>\n <br>\n &#xA0;</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20qf21","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/research-by-qcri-on-viral-social-media-events-shows-people-flock-like-birds","currSlug":"/media-center/research-by-qcri-on-viral-social-media-events-shows-people-flock-like-birds","title":"Research by QCRI on Viral Social Media Events Shows People ‘Flock Like Birds'"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
