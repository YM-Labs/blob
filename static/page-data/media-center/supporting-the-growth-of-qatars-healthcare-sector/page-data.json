Taught under the tutelage of a carefully assembled selection of faculty and research mentors, our programs -- all of which explore the nature of human disease and translation to patients -- are designed to be interactive in nature, with students given the opportunity to apply their learning in the real world and carry out projects in the community.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n CHLS faculty include nine professors whose specializations and achievements in the field of health and life sciences provide students with a unique educational opportunity for growth. Additionally, CHLS&#x2019; faculty and students collaborate with HBKU&#x2019;s research institutes - particularly Qatar Biomedical Research Institute - to facilitate self-driven student research.<br>\n <br>\n The college also enjoys strong bonds with a wide range of stakeholders in the field of health and life sciences, across academia, healthcare and government, including Hamad Medical Corporation, the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, the Ministry of Public Health, the Primary Health Care Corporation, Qatar University, QF member Sidra Medicine, and QF partner university Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180910%20-%20HBKU%20CHLS%20Academic%20Programs%20-%20EN.pdf\">here.</a></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf55","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/supporting-the-growth-of-qatars-healthcare-sector","currSlug":"/media-center/supporting-the-growth-of-qatars-healthcare-sector","title":"Supporting The Growth Of Qatar’s Healthcare Sector"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
