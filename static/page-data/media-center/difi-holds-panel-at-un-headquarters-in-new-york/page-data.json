The DIFI event shed light on the critical role of non-governmental organizations in providing the necessary support and assistance to families and their members affected by wars and conflicts. The discussion sought to highlight and present the experiences of NGOs in Qatar in providing support to populations affected by wars and conflicts. <br>\n <br>\n The event began with opening remarks from H.E. Sheikha Alya Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the United Nations, followed by introductory remarks from Ms. Noor Al Malki Al-Jehani Executive Director, DIFI.

We view our partnerships with other national organizations as very important to raising and discussing issues of concern to the family and to strengthening and combating poverty and achieving the permanent empowerment of poor families.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n DIFI is a global policy and advocacy Institute working to advance knowledge on Arab families, through research, and the promotion of evidence-based polices at a national, regional, and international level.
