The national license entitles Qatar to use one of the largest eBook collections worldwide containing scientific, technical and medical content.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Claudia Lux, Project Director of Qatar National Library, said, &#x201C;Qatar National Library&#x2019;s approach is truly different. We have managed to open a library digitally first, while other national libraries have been doing it the other way round. We are glad to expand our service offerings by partnering with Springer to offer everyone in Qatar full access to Springer&#x2019;s electronic scientific content.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The agreement offers country-wide access to Springer&#x2019;s electronic scientific content. Anyone who lives in Qatar and has a valid Qatari ID or residence permit is eligible to register at the library free of charge. In this way, all registered members of the library will benefit from the national license without any limitations on user classifications.<br>\n <br>\n To view the list of offered online resources visit: <a href=\"http://www.qnl.qa/find-answers/online-resources\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.qnl.qa/find-answers/online-resources</a><br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/02_11_2013%20Springer%20and%20QNL%20PR%20-ENGLISH-FINAL.pdf\">click here</a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15qf61","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-residents-gain-access-to-ebooks-and-online-journals-through-qatar-national-library-and-springer-agreement","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-residents-gain-access-to-ebooks-and-online-journals-through-qatar-national-library-and-springer-agreement","title":"Qatar Residents Gain Access To Ebooks And Online Journals Through Qatar National Library And Springer Agreement"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
