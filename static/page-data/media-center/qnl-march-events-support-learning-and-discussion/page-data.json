The workshop will shed light on the historical importance and beauty of the Kufic script, and will include a practical training session. <br>\n <br>\n QNL&#x2019;s March book discussion will focus on &#x2018;The Reason I Jump&#x2019;, by Naoki Higashida; a book that provides a rare insight into the behavior of autistic children. <br>\n <br>\n In addition, QNL will organize a free workshop on the &#x2018;English Writing Process&#x2019;. The workshop is tailored for those who want to deepen their understanding of the stages of English writing. <br>\n <br>\n In QNL&#x2019;s Music Day, participants can take part in free training sessions on the effective use of selected online music resources, including Naxos, Oxford University Press, OverDrive and ProQuest.

The hobby, which has taken the world by storm, is likened to meditation as it helps to reduce anxiety and increase focus. <br>\n <br>\n Additionally, QNL will raise its regional profile by participating in the 23rd Annual Conference and Exhibition of Special Libraries Association/Arabian Gulf Chapter (SLA-AGC), taking place from March 7 - 9 in Bahrain.
