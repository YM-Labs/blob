This project will lead to applications in many fields, immediate use of which in Qatar includes insulation of buildings and houses. Also new thermal insulation materials would reduce energy consumption and provide comfort and protection from fire.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Saoud and Dr. Massimo Bertino, associate professor of physics, College of Humanities and Sciences, VCU Richmond, co-lead on the project, have been developing strong and highly thermal insulating materials using alternative fabrication methods.<br>\n <br>\n <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/VCUQatarAerogelsProjectAwardedNPRPGrant.pdf\"> For the full story, please click here.</a><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf2","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/vcuqatar-research-project-awarded-nprp-grant","currSlug":"/media-center/vcuqatar-research-project-awarded-nprp-grant","title":"VCUQatar Research Project Awarded NPRP Grant"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
