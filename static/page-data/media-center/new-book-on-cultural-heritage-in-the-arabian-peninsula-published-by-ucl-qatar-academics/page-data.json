Museums and heritage sites are symbols of shifting national identities, and a way of placing the Arabian Peninsula states on the international map. Global, i.e. Western, heritage standards and practices have been utilized for the rapid injection of heritage expertise in museum development and site management and for international recognition.<br>\n <br>\n The use of Western heritage models in the Arabian Peninsula inspires two key areas for research which this book examines: the obscuring of indigenous concepts and practices of heritage and expressions of cultural identity; and the tensions between local/community concepts of heritage and identity and the new national identities being constructed through museums and heritage sites at a state level.<br>\n <br>\n <em>Cultural Heritage in the Arabian Peninsula: Debates, Discourses and Practices</em> can be purchased through the publisher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781409470076\">Ashgate</a>. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story on Georgetown&apos;s website, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/qatar/qatar-news/2014-05-15\">click here</a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10qf60","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/new-book-on-cultural-heritage-in-the-arabian-peninsula-published-by-ucl-qatar-academics","currSlug":"/media-center/new-book-on-cultural-heritage-in-the-arabian-peninsula-published-by-ucl-qatar-academics","title":"New Book on Cultural Heritage in the Arabian Peninsula Published by UCL Qatar Academics"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
