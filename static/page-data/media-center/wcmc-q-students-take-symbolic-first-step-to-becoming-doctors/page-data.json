Having completed their largely theoretical pre-medical training, the new cadre of students will now begin to learn the hands-on practical skills and advanced material of the college&#x2019;s medical program. <br>\n <br>\n The Class of 2017 is drawn from 19 countries, and nine Qatari nationals are enrolled on the course. In total, 33 students were admitted upon completion of the WCMC-Q medical program, while four students completed the biological science&#x2019;s bachelor&#x2019;s degree at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar and four completed their training at other institutions. <br>\n <br>\n <strong>For the full story, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/130914%20English%20WCMC-Q%20students%20take%20symbolic%20first%20step%20to%20becoming%20doctors.pdf\">here</a>.</strong><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf88","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcmc-q-students-take-symbolic-first-step-to-becoming-doctors","currSlug":"/media-center/wcmc-q-students-take-symbolic-first-step-to-becoming-doctors","title":"WCMC-Q Students Take Symbolic First Step To Becoming Doctors"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
