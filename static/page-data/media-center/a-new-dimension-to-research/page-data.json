This included modules on research operation; laboratory management; grants management; research integrity; clinical management; and professional skills.<br>\n <br>\n The students worked in one of WCM-Q&#x2019;s laboratories according to their interests.<br>\n <br>\n Raghad Al-Ishaq, who is studying biomedical science at QU, joined the laboratory of Dr. Khaled Machaca, WCM-Q&#x2019;s associate dean for research and professor of physiology and biophysics.<br>\n <br>\n Raghad said: &#x201C;I interned in Dr. Machaca&#x2019;s lab where he is working on calcium signaling. The work we&#x2019;ve been doing involves injecting certain proteins into the oocytes of frogs of the genus Xenopus, which will help with understanding the fertilization processes. I&#x2019;ve also done some work to understand the expression of a certain protein inside a cell, which has implications for cancer treatments.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve also been involved in a review article with Dr. Dietrich B&#xFC;sselberg about the health implications of vitamin D deficiency on the cardiovascular and renal systems.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been amazing. I&#x2019;ve worked in labs at QU, but wanted to experience this as well.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n She added that in the future she wants to specialize in genetics.<br>\n <br>\n This year is the first time the internship for national college students has run, although WCM-Q already has well-established internship programs for both national high school students and college graduates with an interest in research.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Research-1-24.jpg\" alt=\"Research-1.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Dr. Machaca, who has overseen the introduction of the internships, said outreach programs like these are being offered and expanded because of their popularity, value, and importance to Qatar&#x2019;s future knowledge-based economy.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Machaca said: &#x201C;Alongside conducting research, academic institutions have a duty and are committed to promoting training and outreach to increase research capacity and knowhow within Qatar. Internships like these complement the students&#x2019; education, and provide another layer of experience, enriching their understanding of research and ability to tackle and solve problems.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I am very pleased to say that all three of these interns have proved themselves to be focused, inquisitive, and highly competent, and have very promising careers ahead of them.&#x201D; <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf36","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/a-new-dimension-to-research","currSlug":"/media-center/a-new-dimension-to-research","title":"A New Dimension to Research"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
