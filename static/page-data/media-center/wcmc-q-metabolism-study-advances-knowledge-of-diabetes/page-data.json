For many years, medical science has known that several metabolites are associated with diabetes. By extending the scope of the study to multiple body fluids the researchers at WCMC-Q were able to identify many new diabetes-associated metabolites, enhancing the body of knowledge that exists about the disease. <br>\n <br>\n In addition, the WCMC-Q scientists used the research data to create a comprehensive &#x201C;map&#x201D; of the complex network of metabolic reactions underlying type-2 diabetes. This will serve as a reference tool for researchers as they try to develop new biomarkers for early detection of diabetes and more effective therapies to treat the disease. <br>\n <br>\n The full article can be read at: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-015-3636-2\">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-015-3636-2 </a><br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/150830%20English%20WCMC-Q%20metabolism%20study%20advances%20knowledge%20of%20diabetes.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong>.</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf75","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcmc-q-metabolism-study-advances-knowledge-of-diabetes","currSlug":"/media-center/wcmc-q-metabolism-study-advances-knowledge-of-diabetes","title":"WCMC-Q Metabolism Study Advances Knowledge of Diabetes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
