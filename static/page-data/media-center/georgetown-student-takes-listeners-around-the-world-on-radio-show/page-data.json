Around the World in 30 Minutes, a show which Wehbe started and produced, involved weekly interviews with ambassadors who discussed their country&#x2019;s tourism industry, culture and cuisine. Countries featured on the show included Canada, France, Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, Japan, Brazil, South Africa, Cuba and Germany.<br>\n <img width=\"4900\" height=\"3673\" alt=\"Sami%20Wehbe%20in%20QFRadio%20station.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Sami-20Wehbe-20in-20QFRadio-20station.jpg\"><br>\n &#x201C;As students, we are exposed to politicians and the diplomatic community from very early on. This definitely gave me confidence in dealing with the diplomatic elites of Doha,&#x201D; explained Wehbe. &#x201C;In addition, our curriculum has aided me tremendously in addressing political matters and sensitivities in the phrasing of interview questions. The ambassadors were very impressed with what I knew about their countries, as well as the questions that I directed towards them. This has a lot to do with what I learned at Georgetown.&#x201D;<br>\n <img width=\"1023\" height=\"725\" alt=\"null\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Sami-20Wehbe-20with-20former-20Ambassador-20of-20Switzerland-20H_E_-20Martin-20Aeschbacher.jpg\"><br>\n Wehbe was assisted by fellow Georgetown student Omar Al-Khateeb (SFS &#x2018;18) who helped with researching countries for the Around the World in 30 Minutes show. Al-Khateeb recorded a two minute segment for each show to introduce listeners to the country in question, briefing them on basic facts including the capital city, population and geographical location. <br>\n Working at the radio station involved intensive training in how to use the equipment and edit audio, as well as how to present the weather, traffic and news, and host a show. As part of his work for the Rise show, Wehbe had to wake up daily at 05:00 a.m. and be at the station half an hour before the 06:30 a.m. start, before returning to the Georgetown campus for a full day of lectures.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The QF Radio team did everything in their power to support and teach me,&#x201D; continued Wehbe. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QF%20Radio%20-%20Feature%20-%20English%20v2.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf90","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/georgetown-student-takes-listeners-around-the-world-on-radio-show","currSlug":"/media-center/georgetown-student-takes-listeners-around-the-world-on-radio-show","title":"Georgetown Student Takes Listeners Around the World on Radio Show"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
