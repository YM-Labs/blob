The initiative aims to improve the social wellbeing of migrant workers in Qatar by providing them with information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and skills.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%201.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"1512\" width=\"2016\"><br>\n On 25 November, 19 volunteers attended an in-depth training session at the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The workshop ensures volunteers are fully adept at providing workers with essential ICT literacy training so they can use the facilities set up by companies at their accommodation. <br>\n <br>\n Officially launched by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, ROTA&#x2019;s role in the Better Connections programme is sponsored by Msheireb Properties, a subsidiary of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF). <br>\n <br>\n Ms Noora Al Rumaihi, Manager, Communications and Public Relations, Msheireb Properties, said: &#x201C;The ICT training of migrant workers has the potential to make lasting positive changes in the lives of these individuals and their families. Msheireb Properties is proud to partner in this initiative as it underscores our commitment to effecting positive change and building human capacity in Qatar.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Furrukh Raza, a Better Connections programme volunteer, said: &#x201C;I volunteered for the Better Connections programme to help migrant workers in Qatar develop an understanding of ICT tools, and to help them develop ICT skills they can use on a daily basis. I&#x2019;m grateful I was able to give back to the community by participating in this initiative, and I urge others to get involved.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Since ROTA joined Better Connections in 2015, the programme has trained a total of 165 volunteers who have gone on to train more than 885 &#x2018;Digital Champions&#x2019; as part the social development initiative.<br>\n <br>\n Anwar Abdelbaki, ICT for Education Manager at ROTA, said: &#x201C;The Better Connections programme is a social development initiative that not only equips migrant workers in Qatar with ICT skills, but also grants our volunteers the opportunity to hone their abilities and become effective training facilitators and positive change agents in our community. This initiative actively contributes to building a knowledge-based economy in Qatar.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n ROTA&#x2019;s sponsor, Msheireb Properties&#x2019; mission is to change the way people think about urban living and improve their overall quality of life through innovations that encourage social interaction, respect for culture and greater care for the environment. Microsoft Qatar and the Sheikh Thani Bin Abdullah Foundation for Humanitarian Services (RAF) are implementing partners in the programme.<br>\n <br>\n The seventh batch of the programme marked the last Better Connections training session for 2016. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/rota.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20qf76","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/rota-volunteers-contribute-to-wellbeing-of-migrant-workers","currSlug":"/media-center/rota-volunteers-contribute-to-wellbeing-of-migrant-workers","title":"ROTA Volunteers Contribute to Wellbeing of Migrant Workers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
