The session, titled Islam in a Global World: A Makerspace, concluded with a joint declaration issued to humanity.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/IMG_7122-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"568\"><br>\n The four-point statement sourced its inspiration from the tenets of Islam and discussed the role of communities across the globe in the face of pressing contemporary challenges. As a concluding stage of the makerspace initiative, participating students will avail the opportunity to present His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani with their hopes for global communities to collaboratively work towards the resolution of world crises. <br>\n <br>\n Organized by CIS&#x2019; Assistant Professor Dr. Mohamed Evren Tok, the makerspace initiative is a novel approach and provides a maiden opportunity for students to gather and collaborate to produce creative results, with each participant harnessing their own academic background, life experiences and internal motivation. Further facilitating students to synergize productively during the course of the day, CIS&#x2019;s communal creative space, where the initiative was conducted, came equipped with stationery, art tools and other constructive resources.<br>\n <br>\n In their declaration to humanity, the students proclaimed that a shared obligation exists to protect and integrate refugees, while affording them basic human rights. Furthermore, they stated that communities must enshrine principles of humanitarianism and work together to holistically address the material and non-material needs of the vulnerable. Building on the theme of collaboration, the authors called for inter-communal dialogue to seek common ground where conflict was rife. Finally, denouncing terrorism in all its forms, the students stressed on the need for a multifaceted approach to combat this global phenomenon, based on the promotion of education and justice. <br>\n <br>\n Makerspace is an initiative under Innovation Space, a cornerstone project of HBKU that is critical to the objectives outlined in the University&#x2019;s 10-year strategic plan. The project was launched with the aim of developing an innovative culture under which novel ideas from the HBKU community may thrive. A series of Innovation Space initiatives are presently underway and are scheduled to be carried out within the University and across the colleges and research institutes, with the aim of addressing topics in humanities, social sciences, engineering, ICT, and health and life sciences.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/171225%20-%20CIS%20Makerspace%20-%20EN.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf46","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-students-organize-makerspace-initiative","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-students-organize-makerspace-initiative","title":"HBKU Students Organize Makerspace Initiative"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
