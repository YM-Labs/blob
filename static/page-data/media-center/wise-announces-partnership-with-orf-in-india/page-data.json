This provided an opportunity for WISE to highlight education issues and bring forward the key importance of education to the global forum. ORF, which organizes the Raisina Dialogue, is a premier non-partisan Indian policy research think-tank with a mission to influence public policy formulation. <br>\n <br>\n WISE CEO Stavros N. Yiannouka, commenting on the announcement, said: &#x201C;The WISE partnership with the Raisina Dialogue presents an exciting new opportunity to strengthen engagement between two leading think-tanks in India and Qatar. Our objective is to leverage our two dynamic forums to engage a wider participation of stakeholders in the crucial issues of education in the global agenda for empowerment and economic and social progress. We are delighted to welcome our Indian colleagues to WISE in November, and look forward to joining them again at the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi early next year.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Welcoming the partnership, Sunjoy Joshi, ORF&#x2019;s Director, remarked, &#x201C;ORF is delighted to announce this partnership with WISE.I am confident that this collaboration will catalyze the formation of new actionable ideas, so essential to our quest of creating a world that is both socially and economically more equitable. We look forward to hosting our colleagues from WISE in New Delhi in the coming months.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n A senior representative of ORF will moderate a session at WISE 2017, and will have the opportunity to meet and engage with new partners in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n The 2017 WISE Summit, an initiative of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF), will take place in Doha on November 14-16 under the theme: Co-exist, Co-create: Learning to Live and Work Together. <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf31","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wise-announces-partnership-with-orf-in-india","currSlug":"/media-center/wise-announces-partnership-with-orf-in-india","title":"WISE Announces Partnership with ORF in India"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
