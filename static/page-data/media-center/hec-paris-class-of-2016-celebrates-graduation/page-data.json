The class comprised 40 Qataris in the SBUM program and 23 Qataris in the EMBA program &#x2013; a true reflection of the growing popularity among Qataris for the programs offered by HEC Paris in Qatar. Also notably, the two programs attracted 31 non-Qataris representing 16 different nationalities, which is indicative of the multinational appeal of the programs. In this year&#x2019;s class, 34 graduates were women. <br>\n <img width=\"1227\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/HEC%20Paris%20in%20Qatar%20Convocation%20Ceremony.jpg\" alt=\"null\"><br>\n Commenting on their success during the ceremony, Prof. Kerbache said: &#x201C;On behalf of HEC Paris in Qatar, I would like to congratulate the graduates of our Class of 2016.

These numbers show our tremendous achievements since we joined Qatar Foundation in June 2010 as the first European partner in Education City. Our presence in Qatar is to bring the finest in Executive Education to the region, in order to contribute to the talent development needs of individuals and organizations.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Assuming the position of Dean and CEO of HEC Paris in Qatar starting in November, Associate Professor Nils Plambeck will replace Prof. Kerbache, who will be stepping down from his role after four years.
