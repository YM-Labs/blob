It also offers a valuable solution for adults who fear public speaking, helping them to overcome those feelings.<br>\n <br>\n &quot;As a former debater, I know the challenges that junior debaters face, and the one challenge that stood out the most was fear of public speaking, which ultimately reflected on my overall performance&#x201D;.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/--------20-------20-------20-------20---20------20-------24.jpg\" alt=\"&#x639;&#x628;&#x62F;&#x627;&#x644;&#x644;&#x647;%20&#x645;&#x645;&#x62B;&#x644;&#x627;&#x64B;%20&#x644;&#x644;&#x641;&#x631;&#x64A;&#x642;%20&#x627;&#x644;&#x642;&#x637;&#x631;&#x64A;%20&#x641;&#x64A;%20&#x628;&#x637;&#x648;&#x644;&#x629;%20&#x627;&#x644;&#x639;&#x627;&#x644;&#x645;.JPG\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n &#x201C;The idea focuses mainly on developing an interactive and entertaining method to explore debating. Debaters can put on their VR headsets and get immersed into a virtual space, allowing the user to interact with their environment.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Mahmoud Barraj, Outreach Program Specialist, QatarDebate, said: &#x201C;A key element of a VR-based approach for debaters training is the level of presence, along with the empathy inflicted on the trainees, that will allow them to experience realistic and emotion-rich situations in a virtual environment&#x201D;.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Barraj praised QatarDebate&#x2019;s continuous exploration of solutions that serve the community, through adopting the latest technologies with the aim of facilitating access to various elements of the art of debate. Several scientific papers have highlighted the significant impact of deploying VR within the education sector.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;VR is still an emerging technology in terms of recognizing its full potential in education,&#x201D; Dr. Barraj said. &#x201C;We must think about what&apos;s possible now, so that when the technology becomes more prevalent, we can leverage it to create life-changing learning experiences.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/English%20Press%20Release%20-%20VR%20Debate%20October%2020%202018.pdf\">here</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf25","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/how-vr-is-creating-a-new-debating-dimension","currSlug":"/media-center/how-vr-is-creating-a-new-debating-dimension","title":"How VR is Creating a New Debating Dimension"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
