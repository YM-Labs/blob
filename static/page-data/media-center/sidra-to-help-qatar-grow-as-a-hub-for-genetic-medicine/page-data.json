The facility&#x2019;s early phase of development is the creation of the Arab consensus genome, which will allow for a deeper understanding of genetic variants that contribute to the health of the Arab population. <br>\n <br>\n Sidra, Illumina, and Alliance Global, Illumina&#x2019;s partner in the Middle East, will work together to implement next-generation sequencing technologies at Sidra&#x2019;s new High-Throughput Genomics Center, set to ramp up operations over the next year. <br>\n <br>\n The initial focus of the facility will cater primarily to high-end applications, including human whole genome sequencing for rare genetic diseases and population studies using Illumina&#x2019;s ultra-high-throughput HiSeq X Ten sequencers. Genome sequencing and population studies are an exciting new field of research, enabling scientists to create truly personalized care based on an individual&#x2019;s own genetic makeup. It will also help improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis for many diseases. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Implementing genomic medicine in and around Qatar requires an Arab reference genome set that will provide an in-depth knowledge of genetic variations in the population group. The new level of sequence-based knowledge of genetic variation, will allow us to implement genomic medicine systematically and on a large scale. This will help Sidra to lead the way in personalizing medical treatment, and delivering the highest level of care to women and children. What we are trying to achieve is a forward looking research and healthcare model that will also benefit future generations,&#x201D; said Sidra&#x2019;s Chief Research Officer Dr. Francesco Marincola. <br>\n <br>\n Sidra aims to harness the transformational impact of genomic medicine by contributing to the genome project announced by Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser at the WISH conference in December 2013. <br>\n <br>\n It will begin by testing select groups of participants in the fall.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Sidra&#x2019;s website, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sidra.org/sidra-to-help-qatar-grow-as-a-hub-for-genetic-medicine/\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf83","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-to-help-qatar-grow-as-a-hub-for-genetic-medicine","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-to-help-qatar-grow-as-a-hub-for-genetic-medicine","title":"Sidra to Help Qatar Grow as a Hub for Genetic Medicine"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
