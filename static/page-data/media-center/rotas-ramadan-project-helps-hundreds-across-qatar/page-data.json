Oxy Qatar also sponsored the many Iftars hosted by ROTA during the Holy Month of Ramadan with the aim of implementing ROTA&#x2019;s various community service initiatives. <br>\n <br>\n One of the ROTA activities included volunteers hosting an Iftar for municipality workers living in the Al Shamal Municipality. This gave volunteers an opportunity to interact with different communities in Qatar, and to build a platform for increased interaction between cultures. Furthermore, an Iftar for municipality workers living in Al Khor was delivered by 25 ROTA volunteers who enjoyed a meal and conversation with more than 40 men from a variety of countries. <br>\n <img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/IMAGE%202.jpg\" alt=\"IMAGE 2.jpg\"><br>\n More than 100 local volunteers gathered to pack and distribute bulk groceries which benefited more than 200 families in need across Qatar, while volunteers worked together to provide a new computer lab for the Bangladesh MHM School in Abu Hamour. <br>\n <br>\n Towards the end of Ramadan, ROTA held an Iftar for the volunteers who took part in the ROTA Ramadan 2016 Project to recognise and celebrate their commitment to serving the wider community in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n During the event, 250 volunteers were praised for their dedication and hard work in participating in the month-long programme of community service activities.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/19-07-2016%20ROTA%20Ramadan%20wrap%20up%20PR%20EN.pdf\"><strong>click here.</strong></a><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20qf84","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/rotas-ramadan-project-helps-hundreds-across-qatar","currSlug":"/media-center/rotas-ramadan-project-helps-hundreds-across-qatar","title":"ROTA’s Ramadan Project Helps Hundreds Across Qatar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
