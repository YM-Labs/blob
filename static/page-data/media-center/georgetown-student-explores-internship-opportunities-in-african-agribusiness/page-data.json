He was also encouraged to pursue his own research interests.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Each intern&#x2019;s skills and interests are reviewed by the company and tasks which fit the individual&#x2019;s strengths and objectives are assigned,&#x201D; explained Alexander.<br>\n <br>\n Working out of Accenture&#x2019;s department of Sustainability Services, Alexander&#x2019;s research focus, &#x2019;How Market Efficiency Yields Agricultural Productivity&#x2018;, was intended to develop a &#x201C;strategy for food security enhancement through the optimization of African agribusiness.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The world population may reach 10 billion people by 2100, the majority of whom will reside in cities,&#x201D; explained Alexander. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Unless productivity improves through methods more sustainable than those of the Green Revolution, food security cannot prevail. This is why I chose to explore the role of infrastructure, institutions and information in improving market efficiency for increased sustainability, food security and long-term business value in the research I conducted at SFS-Qatar and through the internship.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The internship was an independent initiative, but SFS-Qatar mentors Edward Kolla, Assistant Professor in History provided support and assistance prior to the internship.<br>\n <br>\n Alexander hopes to ultimately pursue a PhD in Political Science in order to &#x201C;assess and contribute ideas, which have, and will continue, to shape this world.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Georgetown&apos;s website, please <a href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/417179.html#.UmjU1FPwW1Q\" target=\"_blank\">click here </a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4qf89","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/georgetown-student-explores-internship-opportunities-in-african-agribusiness","currSlug":"/media-center/georgetown-student-explores-internship-opportunities-in-african-agribusiness","title":"Georgetown Student Explores Internship Opportunities in African Agribusiness"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
