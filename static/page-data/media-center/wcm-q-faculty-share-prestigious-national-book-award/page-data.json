Weber, Rodney X. Sharkey and Krystyna Golkowska, in partnership with former WCM-Q professors of writing Mary Ann Rishel, Autumn Watts, and Ian Miller. Their chapter appeared in a book on international writing practices entitled Transnational Writing Program Administration, edited by Dr. David S. Martins from the Rochester Institute of Technology, New York. <br>\n <br>\n The chapter describes challenges that the WCM-Q Writing Program faced in translating American models of writing pedagogy into the context of Arabian Gulf education in Education City, Qatar as well as within an overseas medical school, explained Dr. Alan Weber, Associate Professor of English at WCM-Q. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Our chapter analyzed how our program was able to respond to cohorts of students trained in very different educational paradigms, such as the kuttab system,&#x201D; Dr. Weber said. &#x201C;In this form of traditional Gulf school, the instruction is often teacher- rather than student-centered and memorization of knowledge takes precedence.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n WCM-Q is part of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York and Cornell University at Ithaca, Upstate New York, which is one of the prestigious Ivy League group of institutions renowned for academic excellence. <br>\n <br>\n <br>\n The award was announced at The Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC). The CCCC, which has more than 5,000 members and subscribers, forms part of the NCTE and supports and promotes the teaching and study of composition, rhetoric, and communication skills at college level, both in undergraduate and graduate programs. The National Council of Teachers of English, established in 1911 with 35,000 individual and institutional members worldwide, is the largest, oldest and arguably the most prestigious professional organization for English teachers in world.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Martins, the editor of the book, received the award on behalf of the authors at a ceremony held in Portland, Oregon. Dr. Martins is an Associate Professor of Writing and Writing Director at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Rochester, New York. He also oversees the writing programs at RIT Dubai University, and is an authority in the field of transnational writing instruction and how American writing pedagogies can be adapted to new overseas contexts to best serve students.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170426%20English%20Weill%20Cornell%20Medicine-Qatar%20writing%20faculty%20share%20prestigious%20U.S.%20national%20book%20award.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf84","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-faculty-share-prestigious-national-book-award","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-faculty-share-prestigious-national-book-award","title":"WCM-Q Faculty Share Prestigious National Book Award"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
