The new initiative seeks to recognize students who are actively engaged in the University&#x2019;s many co-curricular programs and leadership development opportunities. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/ZO9A4179-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" width=\"639\" height=\"426\"><br>\n Fifteen students met the program&#x2019;s various level requirements, which include participating in various on- and off-campus activities, peer reflection circles, and leadership workshops. Graduating seniors Sheba George (SFS &#x2019;17), Zarine Bohra (SFS &#x2019;17), Rania Sohail (SFS &#x2019;17), Sania Gesudraz (SFS &#x2019;17), and Thana El Sallabi (SFS &#x2019;17) were awarded gold level status, the highest accolade offered by the program. Alya Al-Hashemi (SFS &#x2019;17), Sena Kang (SFS &#x2019;18), and Alisha Kamran (SFS &#x2019;18) were awarded silver medals, while Normeanne Sison (SFS &#x2019;19), Sondos Moussa (SFS &#x2019;19), Sarah Al-Mutoteh (SFS &#x2019;20), Rafia Al-Jassim (SFS &#x2019;19), and Noor Sheikh (SFS &#x2019;20) achieved bronze status. First year students Aiza Khan (SFS &#x2019;20) and Ibtihal Mohamed (SFS &#x2019;20) were awarded copper medals. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I am very proud of all the students who reflected on their leadership experiences and worked hard on their applications to create such powerful narratives for themselves,&#x201D; said Sandy Kim, assistant director of student leadership development at GU-Q. <br>\n <br>\n To be recognized under the program, GU-Q students needed to demonstrate that they have participated leadership-building activities such as student clubs, internships, honor council, sports, studying abroad, volunteering, research, and student employment. <br>\n <br>\n They then submitted an application towards attaining one of the Hoya Leadership Pathway tiers &#x2013; copper, bronze, silver, and gold &#x2013; which each have specific minimum requirements. For example, to reach the silver tier, Al-Hashemi had to complete a range of activities, then submit reflection papers, attend a coaching session, and join a reflection circle. <br>\n &#x201C;I was required to put into words some things that I knew in my mind but had never had to express explicitly,&#x201D; said Al-Hashemi, speaking about the reflection paper. &#x201C;I&apos;d never written anything similar before, so it was an interesting experience.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Students who meet the criteria for the Hoya Leadership Pathway were honored at a special award banquet at GU-Q, and the seniors were presented with a commemorative pin which they could wear on their robes on graduation. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5qf56","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/gu-q-student-leadership-program-celebrates-first-medal-winners","currSlug":"/media-center/gu-q-student-leadership-program-celebrates-first-medal-winners","title":"GU-Q Student Leadership Program Celebrates First Medal Winners"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
