He then detailed the socio economic impact on Palestinian communities in light of the ongoing struggle to establish a majority benchmark of Jewish citizens. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;When we discuss Jerusalem or Palestine, we don&#x2019;t often use terms like employment, dropout rates, or what the Occupation really means. So I want to focus on that so we can understand what we are talking about,&#x201D; he said.<br>\n <br>\n Kurz demonstrated how the strategy of instituting checkpoints, then building a wall, have effectively cut off the old inner city, and economic center, from the suburbs, where displaced Jerusalemite Palestinians had been relocated. <br>\n <br>\n Combined with Israeli law that punishes Jerusalem&#x2019;s Palestinian citizens by revoking their residency permit if they are gone for more than three years, the impact on Palestinians has been massive, he explained. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Students can&#x2019;t go to school, consumers can&#x2019;t do business, and over 5,000 Palestinian businesses have shut down. Unemployment is at its peak - a 75 percent poverty rate in East Jerusalem alone.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Kurz concluded that it is imperative the central business district be opened back up to the Palestinian people, saying &#x201C;This all has to do with politics. While everyone discusses the two state solution, peace, dialogue, and coexistence, what we should be talking about is human rights and justice.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Georgetown&apos;s website, please <a href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/421661.html#\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5qf10","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/georgetown-university-qatar-presents-the-history-of-jerusalems-changing-demographics","currSlug":"/media-center/georgetown-university-qatar-presents-the-history-of-jerusalems-changing-demographics","title":"Georgetown University Qatar Presents the History of Jerusalem's Changing Demographics"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
