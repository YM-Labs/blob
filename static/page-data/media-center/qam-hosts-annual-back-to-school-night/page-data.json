It&#x2019;s great to find a school that offers a high quality dual-language instructional program in Arabic and English. We are completely satisfied with QAM in terms of its academic program and staff. I&#x2019;ve recommended the school to many of my friends and family because I&#x2019;m confident they&#x2019;ll appreciate the high-quality educational experience.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n QAM believes parental guidance and involvement is critical to a child&#x2019;s development, and has a significant impact on a student&#x2019;s academic and social achievement. QAM is keen to reach out to parents, ensuring they have the information they need to support and benefit their children. Therefore, QAM aims to involve parents in activities such as workshops, support groups, and volunteering activities. <br>\n <br>\n Established in 2014, QAM, which operates under Pre-University Education (PUE) at Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF), is a state-of-the-art elementary school that offers a 50/50 dual-language instructional program in Arabic and English.
