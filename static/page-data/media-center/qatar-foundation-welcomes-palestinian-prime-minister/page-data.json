A welcoming committee received Dr Hamdallah at the Qatar Foundation Visitors Center. <br>\n <br>\n The Prime Minister and his delegation were first shown a presentation that outlined the vision and mission of Qatar Foundation. They were also introduced to Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s many educational initiatives, community development plans, and scientific research programs. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Hamdallah has served as president of An-Najah National University since 1998. He holds a doctorate in applied linguistics from Lancaster University in the UK. He praised Qatar&#x2019;s leadership for their wise investment in science and research and underscored the importance of collaborating with Qatar&#x2019;s academic institutions. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We would like to congratulate this country&#x2019;s leadership, His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Amir of Qatar, and His Highness the Father Amir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, and Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. There is no doubt that Qatar&#x2019;s advancement brings us back to an era in which Arabs and Muslims were pioneers of science and culture,&#x201D; Dr Hamdallah said. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I think that this renaissance is an investment in the Arab world, and we need to invest in education and scientific research, so we congratulate Qatar on this remarkable effort. The investment in human capital will reap rewards for many years to come and it also sets a strong foundation for the rest of the region to follow.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The Prime Minister was also briefed on Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s various sustainability initiatives and climate action solutions. After the presentation, he was shown an impressive 3D scale model of the current buildings and construction projects underway at Qatar Foundation.<br>\n <br>\n Dr Hamdallah explained, &#x201C;We constantly strive to collaborate with educational institutions across Qatar, including Qatar University. We have worked with Qatar University in the past and I have visited it prior to assuming my post as prime minister. We are also keen to work in the field of medical education with Hamad Medical Corporation, since we have a number of Palestinian doctors who are working and undertaking residencies at Hamad Medical Corporation. We have nine doctors working at HMC and we hope that six others will join them in July 2014. We are eager to continue our medical research in all areas, and we look forward to gaining knowledge from the advanced medical expertise in Qatar.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n As the visit drew to a close, Dr Hamdallah signed the visitor&#x2019;s book. The delegation&#x2019;s trip to Doha aims to promote close collaboration in the fields of education, science, and research.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf32","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-welcomes-palestinian-prime-minister","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-welcomes-palestinian-prime-minister","title":"Qatar Foundation Welcomes Palestinian Prime Minister"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
