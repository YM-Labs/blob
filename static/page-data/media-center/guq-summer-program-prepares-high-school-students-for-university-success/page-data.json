GPS, a program unique to Georgetown University in Qatar, is designed to give local high school students a head start in the university application process. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Group%20Photo.JPG.jpeg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"3090\" width=\"4635\"><br>\n Over the course of three weeks, the GPS program gave high school students a competitive advantage and valuable experience developing and practicing the academic and personal skills necessary to successfully meet the challenges of university life. The schedule included full-time classes taught in English, as well as college entrance exam preparation and one-on-one mentoring from Georgetown&#x2019;s own college students and staff. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;GPS is an incredibly beneficial program for students in the final years of high school, because it offers them a chance to experience the academic demands and social environment of university life,&#x201D; said Jacqui Snell, GU-Q&#x2019;s educational enrichment manager and program organizer.<br>\n <br>\n The Dean of Students at GU-Q, Brendan Hill, presided over the award ceremony, which featured speeches from two participating students. The classes, taught by GU-Q staff and alumni, included topics in English, reading, research, note-taking and presentation skills, with particular focus on preparation for university applications. Courses in math focused on applying math to economics with an emphasis on algebra, precalculus, and calculus. <br>\n <br>\n Students were also given a sneak peek into the International Affairs majors offered at GU-Q through lectures, seminars, and activities organized by GU-Q staff. &#x201C;A little taste of each of the majors enables students to determine whether GU-Q is the right place for them. It&#x2019;s a very useful exploratory period for students regardless of whether they ultimately attend Georgetown, because we are teaching students how to make the best choices for themselves,&#x201D; said Snell.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/20160808GPS2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5qf75","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/guq-summer-program-prepares-high-school-students-for-university-success","currSlug":"/media-center/guq-summer-program-prepares-high-school-students-for-university-success","title":"GUQ Summer Program Prepares High School Students for University Success"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
