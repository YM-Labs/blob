The Foundation was set up in the US by the family of J Patrick Barnes, who died in 1999 from an auto-immune disease. <br>\n <br>\n DAISY is an acronym for Diseases Attacking the Immune System. The care Barnes and his family received from nurses during his hospitalization inspired a unique means of thanking nurses who have gone above and beyond their daily routine to ensure patients receive exceptional care.<br>\n <br>\n The award launched by Sidra will recognize nurses at Sidra who are providing extraordinary care for the future of our patients. &#x201C;Nursing is the heart of healthcare and we are proud to join over 1,700 organizations worldwide honoring our nurses with the DAISY Award,&#x201D; said Sidra&#x2019;s Chief Nursing Officer Dr Mary Boyd.<br>\n <br>\n Taking part in the event, Dr Ziyad Hijazi, Sidra&#x2019;s Clinical Chief of Pediatrics, said that he&#x2019;s excited to see the recognition nursing has received as a vital part of healthcare worldwide in the past decade. &#x201C;At Sidra, nurses will play an active part in our interprofessional patient care teams, bringing compassion and expertise to the bedside.&#x201D;<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf43","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-launches-daisy-awards-for-the-first-time-in-qatar-to-honor-nurses","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-launches-daisy-awards-for-the-first-time-in-qatar-to-honor-nurses","title":"Sidra Launches DAISY Awards for the First Time in Qatar to Honor Nurses"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
