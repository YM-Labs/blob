With a shared interest in media coverage of human stories, DIFI and AJMN are working together to promote and emphasise the critical role research and policy discussions can have in helping secure a safe and prosperous future for war-torn families in the region.<br>\n <br>\n The conference will host a panel session, through which three expert Al Jazeera correspondents will share their on-the-ground experience in war and conflict zones in the Arab region. These first-person accounts will add great value to the debate and to the conference and will also include the participation of international and regional civil society organisations such as Save the Children, Qatar Red Crescent and Amel Association International.<br>\n <br>\n On behalf of DIFI, a member of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF), Ms Noor Al Malki Al-Jehani, DIFI Executive Director, stated: &#x201C;We are delighted to be partnering with Al Jazeera Media Network for our Second Annual Conference on Family Research and Policy.
