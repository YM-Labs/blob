Participants also learned about the ever-growing importance and need for engineers, especially in Qatar, and listened to presentations from practicing engineers from industry &#x2013; Abdullah Al Hajri and Ghader Al Eshaq of Dolphin Energy. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;SECQ hosts this event to increase the awareness of engineering to high school students in particular by engaging them in various activities which requires critical thinking,&#x201D; said Lokesh Loganathan, a Class of 2017 chemical engineering major who chaired the event. &#x201C;Furthermore, having it on campus allows us to share the Texas A&amp;M culture and traditions. FAME has once again been a success this year and the feedback that we have received from the schools have been positive, which will push SECQ to keep hosting this conference in the future.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Attendees also learned about leadership development and extracurricular opportunities offered by Texas A&amp;M at Qatar &#x2014; opportunities that shape Aggie engineers into engineering leaders that are so sought after worldwide. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/TAMUQ%20students%20host%20high%20schoolers%20for%20two-day%20engineering%20conference%20-%20English.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf92","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/tamuq-hosts-high-schoolers-for-engineering-conference","currSlug":"/media-center/tamuq-hosts-high-schoolers-for-engineering-conference","title":"TAMUQ Hosts High Schoolers for Engineering Conference"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
