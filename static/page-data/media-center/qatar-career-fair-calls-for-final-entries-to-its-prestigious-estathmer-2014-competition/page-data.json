Candidates have until 18 January 2014 to enter the competition before shortlisting begins. <br>\n <br>\n In partnership with the Bedaya Center for Entrepreneurship and Career Development, QCF is encouraging young Qataris to submit their ideas for a brand new business concept, in the hope of being chosen to showcase their ideas at the Qatar Career Fair 2014 and kick-start their careers. <br>\n <br>\n This year&#x2019;s competition is also open to smaller Qatari businesses wanting to give their existing products and services a boost in the market. <br>\n <br>\n The Estathmer 2014 competition rewards excellence in creativity, innovation, business and presentation and provides the perfect platform for budding entrepreneurs to demonstrate their talents and flair for business. <br>\n <br>\n Those shortlisted will spend a week attending business courses and presentation skills training and will then be invited to present their business proposals to a panel of judges, made up of young, talented Qatari entrepreneurs, who will choose up to five winners with the most outstanding proposals. <br>\n <br>\n The same panel of judges will consider all entries before shortlisting the top 10 businesses. Each of these businesses will then have to face the panel and present their work and activities and prove how they support Qatar&#x2019;s success story around careers. <br>\n <br>\n Following these crucial presentations, winners will be chosen and invited to showcase their businesses to the thousands of people attending the Qatar Career Fair 2014 in April. <br>\n <br>\n Winners from both categories will be given a free booth within the Qatar Career Fair&#x2019;s &#x2018;Startup Arena&#x2019;, gaining invaluable exposure to a plethora of key influencers and peers. They will also be invited to network with potential employees, partners and investors throughout the duration of the Fair. <br>\n <br>\n Registration for the Estathmer 2014 competition opened on 25 November 2013 and the closing date for entries to both the existing small business category and the new business ideas category is the 18 January 2014. The shortlisting process will continue until 2 February and winners will then be informed on 16 February. <br>\n <br>\n For more information about QCF and the Estathmer 2014 competition, please visit:&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.qatarcareerfair.com.qa/en/QCF_2014/QCF_2014_Activities_And_Events/QCF_2014_Activities_And_Events_Istathmer.aspx\">http://www.qatarcareerfair.com.qa/en/QCF_2014/QCF_2014_Activities_And_Events/QCF_2014_Activities_And_Events_Istathmer.aspx </a><br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/16%2001%202014_QCF%20Estathmer%202014%20last%20call%20PR_ENG.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf90","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-career-fair-calls-for-final-entries-to-its-prestigious-estathmer-2014-competition","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-career-fair-calls-for-final-entries-to-its-prestigious-estathmer-2014-competition","title":"Qatar Career Fair Calls For Final Entries To Its Prestigious Estathmer 2014 Competition"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
