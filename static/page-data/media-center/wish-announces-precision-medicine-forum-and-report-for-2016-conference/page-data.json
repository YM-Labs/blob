The crucial measurable results for PM &#x2013; patient outcomes and lowered costs &#x2013; will be discussed, as well as how those can be incentivized within health care systems. <br>\n <br>\n The report will address the benefits of cross-referencing relevant data. Properly analyzing the full breadth of information gathered by health systems has produced unexpected advances in both practice and policy. Guided by the principles of PM, developing the collection and analysis of such data could reveal even better methods to improve healthcare. <br>\n <br>\n In addition, the report will delve into the ever-present legal, ethical, and social concerns surrounding data collection, and will suggest how PM can be supported and funded at the system level, leveraging public-private partnerships to create sustainable, effective change.<br>\n <br>\n The WISH 2016 Summit will feature seven groundbreaking research forums that highlight and address some of the world&#x2019;s most pressing healthcare challenges. In addition to Precision Medicine, the forums will generate interdisciplinary, evidence-based reports on topics including &#x2018;Healthy Populations&#x2019;, &#x2018;Economic Benefits of Investing in Health&#x2019;, &#x2018;Cardiovascular Disease&#x2019;, &#x2018;Accountable Care&#x2019;, &#x2018;Autism&#x2019;, and &#x2018;Behavioral Insights&#x2019;.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/20%2003%2016_WISH%20Precision%20Medicine%20PR_EN_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf97","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-announces-precision-medicine-forum-and-report-for-2016-conference","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-announces-precision-medicine-forum-and-report-for-2016-conference","title":"WISH Announces Precision Medicine Forum and Report for 2016 Conference"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
