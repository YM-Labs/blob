The idea of the National Library was inspired by this glorious history, in hopes of restoring an Arab renaissance that we do not want to lose. The library was established to be a treasury of written history and a medium for the transfer of knowledge between different cultures. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QNL_Image%204-24.jpg\" alt=\"QNL_Image 4.jpeg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n The first book on the shelves of QNL was placed by Her Highness Sheikha Moza in December 2016. <br>\n Guests were welcomed into the library on a bespoke LED carpet, which took invitees through a virtual journey of Qatar&#x2019;s landmarks. After a special presentation marking the inaugural moment, poet Tamim Al-Barghouti gave a speech titled &#x2018;It is still possible&#x2019;, followed by a film showing QNL&#x2019;s journey from concept to grand opening, and a speech by the library&#x2019;s lead architect, Rem Koolhaas, who spoke about the architecture of cultural institutions. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QNL_Image%201-17.jpg\" alt=\"QNL_Image 1.jpeg\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n The event continued with a video message featuring numerous library directors from around the world congratulating QNL on its opening.
