With the timeline of a carbon-neutral FIFA 2022 World Cup coming closer, the journey of sustainability has become quicker, and more challenging. I am looking forward to continue working with my colleagues in the MENA region Green Building Council to advance the agenda of sustainability and health in the built environment.”</p>\n<p>Cristina Gamboa, CEO, World Green Building Council, said: “Whilst climate change is a global challenge, the solutions to it are often local and regional. Championing green building at these levels through our regional networks is therefore essential to deliver on our mission of green buildings for everyone, everywhere. Meshal has been a true champion of sustainability across Qatar, and his leadership as Vice Chair will help to strengthen the network of Green Buildings Councils in the region.”</p>\n<p>The Middle East and North Africa Regional Network comprises nine Green Building Councils based in the Middle East and North Africa Region: Bahrain, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, and Qatar.\nThe MENA region is currently home to over 350 million people, and its population growth has been characterized by rapid urbanization. This is projected to continue, with urban population expected to double from 2010 to 2050, from 200 million to nearly 400 million. This implies a large demand for buildings, complicated by the challenges of conflict-induced displacement of people.</p>\n<p>Yet the MENA region is also set to be critical for the growth of green buildings globally, over the next few years. Green Building Councils in WorldGBC’s MENA Regional Network are responding to the challenges and opportunities on the ground, ensuring that the region’s buildings ensure a high quality of life for people, minimize negative impacts on the environment, and maximize economic benefits.</p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1YvSM3xC7bTMuHsu2VUgvj","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-green-building-council-director-appointed-regional-vice-chair-of","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-green-building-council-director-appointed-regional-vice-chair-of","title":"Qatar Green Building Council Director Appointed Regional Vice Chair of World Green Building Council’s Mena Region"}}}
