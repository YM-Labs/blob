The agencies are the Council of International Schools (CIS) and the Middle States Association (MSA).</p>\n <p>Awsaj Academy is a member of Qatar Foundation. It began the accreditation process in 2008 through CIS, and conducted a full-scale self-study during the 2009-2010 academic year. In response to a site visit by CIS in March 2011, Awsaj continued working on its initial application and CIS agreed to have MSA join in awarding final accreditation this year.</p>\n <p>Currently, more than 300 schools throughout the world have earned CIS accreditation, which &#x2018;demonstrates that a member school has achieved high standards of professional performance in international education and has a commitment to continuous improvement,&#x2019; according to CIS&#x2019; own guidelines. Meanwhile, MSA has accredited more than 3,000 institutions in 85 countries.</p>\n <p>According to MSA, &#x2018;The accreditation process validates to the public the integrity of a school&apos;s program and student transcripts. The accreditation process assures a school community that the school&apos;s purposes are appropriate and are being accomplished through a viable educational program. The accreditation process justifies the faith and resources others place in the school.&#x2019;</p>\n <p>Awsaj Academy is both a grades 1-12 school, addressing the needs of students with learning challenges, and an outreach center that provides evaluation and professional development services to the community. Awsaj moved into a new state-of-the-art facility in November 2011, and is currently expanding its enrollment, which has more than doubled in the past two years to 265 students.</p>\n <p>Ultimately, the goal is to phase in additional classes until the academy reaches a maximum capacity of 500 students.</p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2qf2","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/awsaj-academy-achieves-international-accreditation","currSlug":"/media-center/awsaj-academy-achieves-international-accreditation","title":"Awsaj Academy Achieves International Accreditation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
