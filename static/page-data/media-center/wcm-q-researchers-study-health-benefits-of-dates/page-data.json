They then gave them a substantial amount of Deglet Noor dates to eat, and took five blood samples at half-hourly intervals. A week later, the volunteers returned to the clinic and the process was repeated with Khalas dates. As a control experiment, the same process was also conducted with a glucose drink containing only sugar.<br>\n <br>\n Date palms are an extremely important crop in the Middle East as they are extremely well adapted to dry, sandy environments. This project is part of a long and continuing interest that WCM-Q researchers have in the date palm. In 2012 they were awarded a National Priorities Research Program &#x2013; Exceptional Proposals (NPRP-EP) grant from Qatar National Research Fund (X-014-4-001) to advance research efforts in basic research, translational and clinical research on date palms. <br>\n <br>\n WCM-Q researchers have also created the first known &#x2018;Dates Bio-Bank&#x2019; which records the characteristics of more than 250 different varieties of date fruits collected from 15 countries, including Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan, Libya, Tunisia, USA, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, Oman and Spain. Of these, the researchers have metabolically characterized 110 date fruit varieties. In the future, by combing this data with the results from the new bioavailability study, it shall be possible to predict the specific health benefits of each date variety.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160622%20English%20WCM-Q%20researchers%20study%20health%20benefits%20of%20dates.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf30","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-researchers-study-health-benefits-of-dates","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-researchers-study-health-benefits-of-dates","title":"WCM-Q Researchers Study Health Benefits Of Dates"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
