The five-year educational campaign targets all sections of society, with a particular focus on helping young people aged between 10 and 25 years to make positive, healthy lifestyle decisions. <br>\n <br>\n Following the success of last year&#x2019;s handpicked Innovation Showcases, this year WISH&#x2019;s Showcases were opened up to entries from around the globe and received 80 applications from 26 countries in all areas of health innovation: digital health, healthcare products, design-solutions and innovative health systems and services. Selected entries, including &#x2018;Your Health First&#x2019;, will be given the chance to present their ideas to more than 1,000 leading global healthcare experts attending the 2015 Summit. <br>\n <br>\n &#x2018;Your Health First&#x2019; was launched in 2012 by HE Abdulla bin Khalid Al-Qahtani, Minister of Public Health, with a plan to raise awareness of the issue of obesity in Qatar where 70 per cent of adults are overweight and 41 per cent obese. <br>\n <br>\n HE Abdullah bin Khalid Al Qahtani underscored the importance of community-wide health awareness initiatives, asserting that: &#x201C;Health is not limited to large-scale projects, hospitals and health centers, but it is far more important to promote health awareness and healthier lifestyles among the population. These efforts directly contribute to the fulfillment of health objectives that are aligned with Qatar National Health Strategy 2011-2016 and Qatar National Vision 2030.&#x201D;<br>\n <img width=\"784\" height=\"494\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Weill%20Cornell%20unibranded%20logo.jpg\" alt=\"Weill Cornell unibranded logo.jpg\"><br>\n His Excellency added: &#x201C;&#x2019;Your Health First&#x2019; is a crucial initiative due to its leading role in promoting health awareness, and it is imperative that it is presented at the World Innovation Summit for Health as an Innovation Showcase that delegates could learn from, alongside other unique global healthcare innovations to be revealed at the Summit.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Professor the Lord Darzi of Denham, Executive Chair of WISH, said: &#x201C;Our Innovation Showcases aim to highlight new ideas that have the potential to help transform healthcare worldwide. Educational campaigns such as &#x2018;Your Health First&#x2019; strongly support Qatar&#x2019;s journey toward the fulfillment of Qatar National Vision 2030&#x2019;s goals in healthcare, and we are delighted to showcase a key Qatari initiative that further contributes to our mission of disseminating the best ideas in healthcare for the benefit of communities all over the globe.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on WISH&#x2019;s website, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/150112%20English%20Diabetes%20Prevention%20Should%20Focus%20on%20Lifestyle%20Factors.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28qf52","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-to-showcase-qatari-healthcare-initiative-your-health-first","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-to-showcase-qatari-healthcare-initiative-your-health-first","title":"WISH to Showcase Qatari Healthcare Initiative ‘Your Health First’"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
