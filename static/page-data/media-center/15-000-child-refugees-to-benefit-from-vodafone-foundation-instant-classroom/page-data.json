The tablets can connect to the laptop locally, enabling teachers to deliver content and applications to students without the need to access the internet.<br>\n <img width=\"639\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Vodafone%20InstantClassroomPICa-17.jpg\" alt=\"Vodafone Instant Classroom\"><br>\n All the components of the Vodafone Foundation Instant Classroom can be charged simultaneously from a single power source while the case is locked. After 6-8 hours of charging time, the Instant Classroom can be used for a full day in a classroom without access to electricity.<br>\n <br>\n Over the next year, the Vodafone Foundation Instant Classroom will be deployed to 12 schools in refugee settlements in Kakuma in Kenya, in the Nyarungusu refugee settlement in Tanzania and in the Equatorial Region in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Instant Classroom will provide up to 15,000 children and young adults aged from 7 to 20 with advanced teaching aids that are currently only available in a minority of schools in developed nations. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Instant%20Classroom%20ENG.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf21","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/15-000-child-refugees-to-benefit-from-vodafone-foundation-instant-classroom","currSlug":"/media-center/15-000-child-refugees-to-benefit-from-vodafone-foundation-instant-classroom","title":"15,000 Child Refugees to Benefit from Vodafone Foundation ‘Instant Classroom’"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
