Dr. Qoronfleh linked food choice and diet to memory, arguing that a healthy and balanced diet contributes to diverse gut bacteria. His presentation is furthered by recent research being conducted, which establishes links between the bacteria and the brain, suggesting an existence of bacterial memory.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Qoronfleh said: &#x201C;I was honored to be invited as keynote speaker for this event. The impact of food choice and diet is often examined in the research community through the lens of obesity and its effect on our bodies. While that certainly is important, it is equally as important to investigate the impact of food and gut bacteria on the health of our brain, and how it is translated into human behavior.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Qoronfleh has more than 20 years of experience in biotechnology, with a research interest in medical microbiology, biotechnology and diagnostics, and healthcare. He is also a member of the Arab Expatriate Scientists group in Qatar, and helped co-author the document for establishing QBRI. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/161213%20Walid%20Qoronfleh%20-%20EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf54","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qbris-biotech-director-gives-keynote-address-at-international-workshop","currSlug":"/media-center/qbris-biotech-director-gives-keynote-address-at-international-workshop","title":"QBRI’s Biotech Director Gives Keynote Address at International Workshop"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
