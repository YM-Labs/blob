Furthermore, recent analysis of contributor feedback demonstrates that the Qatari community is confident about the nation&#x2019;s largest population-based health initiative. <br>\n <br>\n Qatar Biobank&#x2019;s recently appointed Managing Director, Dr Hadi Abderrahim said, &#x201C;Our relationship with the public is at the heart of what we do, and is critical to our success. Our intentions are not just to get people through the door, but are instead about engaging the wider community.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Through its recruitment approach Qatar Biobank aims to provide a model for public involvement in biomedical research. By inviting the public to contribute, it empowers the local community to take on an active role as &#x2018;citizen scientists&#x2019;, helping to shape the health of future generations.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We aim to educate the public which in turn enables them to relish the opportunity to participate. Then when they visit, we make every effort to ensure they have a five-star experience; and we are extremely pleased to see that this message is actively being communicated by word of mouth throughout the community.&#x201D; <br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf11","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/word-of-mouth-sees-72-percent-of-the-community-contribute-to-qatar-biobank","currSlug":"/media-center/word-of-mouth-sees-72-percent-of-the-community-contribute-to-qatar-biobank","title":"‘Word Of Mouth’ Sees 72 Percent Of The Community Contribute To Qatar Biobank"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
