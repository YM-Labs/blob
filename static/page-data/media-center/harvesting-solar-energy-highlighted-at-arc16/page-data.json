The discussion focussed on water and energy security, two of the nation&#x2019;s Research Grand Challenges stipulated in the Qatar National Research Strategy (QNRS). <br>\n <img src=\"https://cdn.qf.com.qa/app/media/250\" alt=\"null\"><br>\n The session began with an overview of Qatar Environment &amp; Energy Research Institute&#x2019;s (QEERI) water security, energy security and environmental security projects. In addition, the various means of creating solar-powered energy, its influence on major developments in Qatar, and the use of material science to solve energy-environmental issues, were explored in detail. <br>\n <br>\n Overall, the projects explore new ideas, and open avenues of research, which have the potential for advancing QEERI&#x2019;s Grand Challenge projects and of attracting external funding and strategic partnerships.<br>\n <br>\n The panel discussion, entitled &#x2018;Materials for Solar Energy Harvesting and Photovoltaic (PV) Technologies&#x2019;, featured presentations from industry experts Dr Khalid Al-Subai, QEERI, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU); Professor Sukekatsu Ushioda, National Institute for Material Science (NIMS), Japan; Professor David Mitzi, Duke University, USA; and Professor J&#xF6;rg Bagdahn, Fraunhofer CSP, Germany. The session was moderated by Dr Said Ahzi, QEERI. <br>\n <br>\n The Annual Research Conference has served as QF R&amp;D&#x2019;s flagship event since 2010, providing a unique platform for knowledge-sharing and collaboration between Qatar&#x2019;s brightest scientific minds and leading international researchers as they work to tackle the nation&#x2019;s Research Grand Challenges.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/22-03-2016%20ARC&apos;16%20Energy%20Environment%20Session_En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a><br>\n &#xA0;</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf16","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/harvesting-solar-energy-highlighted-at-arc16","currSlug":"/media-center/harvesting-solar-energy-highlighted-at-arc16","title":"Harvesting Solar Energy Highlighted at ARC’16"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
