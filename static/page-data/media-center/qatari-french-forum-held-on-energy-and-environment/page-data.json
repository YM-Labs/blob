The theme of the forum &#x2013; energy and environment &#x2013; is a timely one for dialogue among partners in Qatar, the region, and beyond. This is a global concern at a time when the energy industry is the main cause of many environment issues such as pollution, climate change and global warming.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n H.E. Mr Chevallier said: &#x201C;The Qatar France Academia-Industry Forum Initiative aims to reinforce academic and industrial French participation to Qatar&#x2019;s knowledge-based economy and capacity building within the framework of Qatar National Vision 2030, which has engaged the country in sustainable development, relying on groundbreaking research, innovation and cutting-edge technology. In this context, we expected very concrete outcomes from this forum, and I am happy the results went beyond our expectations.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Mr. Chalmin said: &#x201C;We are honored to have been a part of the Qatari-French Academia &amp; Industry Initiative 2016, which was a platform for fruitful discussion in energy and environment matters. We would like to thank Qatar Foundation and Qatar University, under whose patronage this event took place, and Institut Francais du Qatar, Engie, Veolia, and Alstom for being co-sponsors of the event. Our collaboration not only entails us to help create a dynamic global community where educators and industry stakeholders can work openly to identify common projects, and develop the energy sector, it also enables us to support the building of a knowledge-based economy in Qatar through supporting innovation and sustainable initiatives.&#x201D;<br>\n &#xA0;<br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/qatari-french%20forums.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf17","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatari-french-forum-held-on-energy-and-environment","currSlug":"/media-center/qatari-french-forum-held-on-energy-and-environment","title":"Qatari-French Forum Held on Energy and Environment"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
