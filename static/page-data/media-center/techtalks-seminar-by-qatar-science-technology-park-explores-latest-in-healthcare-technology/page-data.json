However unless these solutions are focused on specific local needs, it will not be sufficient.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Dr Justin Grantham commented that the use of information and communication technologies in healthcare has generated skepticism because this can be too technology-driven and may not always integrate well with the complexities of existing workflows in clinical practice. <br>\n <br>\n He added, &#x201C;Technology is only part of the solution in the long term management of disease. Disease management also comes down to the lifestyle choices that individuals make. Aside from the proper implementation, technology also needs to engage people to be more pro-active and involved in their health management and subsequently improve their quality of life&#x201D;. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Grantham has been working in collaboration with QSTP on the RASAD telehealth platform since 2009. <br>\n Dr Esam Masoud addressed the implications of technology on the health insurance sector. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The biggest concern for everyone today is the increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and coronary diseases. The only real effective way to reduce the burden of rising insurance pay outs in claims is to prevent the occurrences of these diseases in the first place. There is a need to explore how technology can help achieve this in the most cost effective way.&#x201D;<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf28","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/techtalks-seminar-by-qatar-science-technology-park-explores-latest-in-healthcare-technology","currSlug":"/media-center/techtalks-seminar-by-qatar-science-technology-park-explores-latest-in-healthcare-technology","title":"TECHtalks Seminar by Qatar Science & Technology Park Explores Latest in Healthcare Technology"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
