Avoid eating or drinking at places that do not look clean, ensure you drink only safe water and don&#x2019;t buy food from street vendors.<br>\n <img width=\"639\" height=\"426\" alt=\"Dr Ravinder Mamtani\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/ATE-Travel_M7184-17.jpg\"><br>\n &#x201C;Always ensure that your food is thoroughly cooked and served hot. Observe good hand hygiene and carry hand sanitizing wipes or gel. These measures will help to reduce the risk of stomach upset and infections, which can really ruin a holiday.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The Ask the Expert series is part of WCMC-Q&#x2019;s Sahtak Awalan: Your Health First campaign, a five-year initiative that aims to encourage members of both the expat and Qatari communities to make healthy lifestyle choices. The events, which are free to attend, begin with a presentation before the audience gets a chance to &#x2018;ask the expert&#x2019; during an interactive Q&amp;A session. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Mamtani advised those with long-term medical conditions to seek advice from their physician before they travel and to take plenty of medication with them. Carry a list of reputable hospitals in your destination and ensure your health insurance is adequate and that you have a copy of your policy. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/150513%20English%20WCMC-Q%20offers%20expert%20advice%20on%20travel%20health.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf80","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcmc-q-offers-expert-advice-on-travel-health","currSlug":"/media-center/wcmc-q-offers-expert-advice-on-travel-health","title":"WCMC-Q Offers Expert Advice on Travel Health"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
