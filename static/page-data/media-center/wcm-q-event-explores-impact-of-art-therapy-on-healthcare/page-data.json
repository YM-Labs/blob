He said: &#x201C;Visual art can have a very significant impact on healthcare in many ways. This includes the effect that the d&#xE9;cor of a hospital has on a patient&#x2019;s sense of wellbeing, the use of comic books to help medical students understand their patients better, and encouraging students to study fine art to develop their ability to interpret and assimilate complex visual information, which is particularly important when interpreting physical symptoms or medical images such as x-rays or CT scans.&#x201D; <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo5-17.jpg\" alt=\"Photo5.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n Dr. Rifai explained the use of art therapy along with medications to address the symptoms of apathy and social withdrawal in patients with schizophrenia. She also described the benefits of using art therapy in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease who are able to engage in such therapies even after they have lost their language ability and many other aspects of their cognition.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Art therapy can be an extremely effective treatment but it is not widely practiced in the Gulf region. This event forms part of a wider effort to encourage the use of art therapy in Qatar, where appropriate, for the benefit of patients.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The activity was open to healthcare professionals of all disciplines from WCM-Q and other healthcare institutions and was accredited locally by the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners-Accreditation Department (QCHP-AD) and internationally by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME).<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf77","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-event-explores-impact-of-art-therapy-on-healthcare","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-event-explores-impact-of-art-therapy-on-healthcare","title":"WCM-Q Event Explores Impact of Art Therapy on Healthcare"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
