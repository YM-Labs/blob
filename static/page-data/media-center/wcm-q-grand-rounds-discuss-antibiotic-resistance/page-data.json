Small fiber neuropathy can be caused by many different diseases, including diabetes, and is characterized by pain, loss of sensation, and burning or tingling sensations. It is caused by damage to the small nerve fibers and usually affects the extremities. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo1-24.jpg\" alt=\"Photo1.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Prof. Lauria said: &#x201C;Chronic neuropathic pain affects around five percent of the general population. It has a major impact on the patient&#x2019;s quality of life and increases healthcare costs substantially. The other very important thing is that there are no tailored treatments &#x2013; we treat patients with the same available drugs. But in the last few years we have begun moving towards precision medicine approaches for neuropathic pain which is a big challenge but also could bring great benefits to patients.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Ali Sultan, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at WCM-Q presented at Grand Rounds on the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. He explained that antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change and become resistant to the antibiotics used to treat the infections they cause. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo4-24.jpg\" alt=\"Photo4.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Dr. Sultan then discussed the Global Action Plan to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR), adopted by the World Health Organization in 2015. This calls on member states to develop national plans to raise awareness of AMR, improve surveillance, invest in research and development, and reduce incidence of infection in healthcare institutions, the wider community and animals. Better AMR stewardship is also recommended, part of which involves providing training to physicians to promote selection of the optimal antibiotic regimen by doctors, including dosage, duration and route of administration. <br>\n <br>\n Both lectures were accredited locally by the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners-Accreditation Department (QCHP-AD) and internationally by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME).<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180411_20English_20Antibiotic_20resistance_20and_20neuropathic_20pain_20discussed_20at_20W....pdf\">here</a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf88","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-grand-rounds-discuss-antibiotic-resistance","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-grand-rounds-discuss-antibiotic-resistance","title":"WCM-Q Grand Rounds Discuss Antibiotic Resistance"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
