consideration should present a barrier to a person’s development, their pursuit of opportunity, and their voice being heard in global conversations about topics, themes, and challenges that affect all of society.</p>\n<p>“The pledge we announce today is a natural, visible, and powerful extension of this belief. Through our investment in education and our ethos as an organization, Qatar Foundation’s commitment to providing opportunities for everyone to be an active participant in society is personified by the diversity of the achievers and role models we nurture, and the impact they are making in a wide spectrum of fields within Qatar and beyond.</p>\n<p>“Now, by committing to having at least 50 percent female representation on all our conference and event panels from 2020 onward, we aim to further emphasize Qatar Foundation’s role as a leader and driver of inclusivity and positive social change, nationally and regionally – and the necessity of both men and women being part of making this change happen.”</p>\n<p>QF’s Education City ‘multiversity’ – home to nine universities – has a predominantly female student body, in which half of its engineering students are women. Meanwhile, women comprise 40 percent of QF’s leadership. </p>\n<p>In 2018, QF hosted around 40 major local and international events, collectively attended by over 55,000 people. Among the platforms that will represent QF’s ’50 percent female’ pledge on the international stage are the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) and the World Innovation Summit for Health (WISH), QF initiatives respectively focused on shaping the future of education and healthcare through innovation and global collaboration. </p>\n<p>Their events include biennial international summits that bring together decision-makers, thought leaders, and education and health practitioners from around the world, and include high-level panel sessions. The most recent WISE Summit, in 2017, saw over 100 speakers contribute to more than 50 sessions, with 2,000 delegates attending from over 150 countries. Meanwhile, almost 2,200 healthcare experts from 116 nations participated in the WISH 2018 Summit, which featured 22 expert panels.</p>"}}},{"__typename":"ContentfulModuleImageGallery","id":"c57775d5-e363-5a46-bfb5-46efd52cd915","images":[{"caption":null,"image":{"id":"3fb6a9f3-08b0-55fe-90ce-cab45ebdc6a5","title":"Image2","file":{"details":{"image":{"width":1413,"height":1132}}},"sizes":{"aspectRatio":1.8666666666666667,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=280&h=150&q=85 280w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=560&h=300&q=85 560w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85 1120w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=1413&h=757&q=85 1413w","srcWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85&fm=webp","srcSetWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=280&h=150&q=85&fm=webp 280w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=560&h=300&q=85&fm=webp 560w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=1120&h=600&q=85&fm=webp 1120w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=1413&h=757&q=85&fm=webp 1413w","sizes":"(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px"},"singleMode":{"aspectRatio":1.7906976744186047,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=1540&h=860&q=85&fit=pad","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=385&h=215&q=85&fit=pad 385w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=770&h=430&q=85&fit=pad 770w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=1413&h=789&q=85&fit=pad 1413w","srcWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=1540&h=860&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad","srcSetWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=385&h=215&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad 385w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=770&h=430&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad 770w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/2h1qowfuxkq7/4cf77bAtHRIMuiXHkrD8Ym/2c05c966dc84a0b05e0479875d6c97e4/Image2.jpg?w=1413&h=789&q=85&fm=webp&fit=pad 1413w","sizes":"(max-width: 1540px) 100vw, 1540px"}}}]},{"__typename":"ContentfulModuleBodyText","id":"0a781321-59f4-54c2-b677-bc1e28ac23c4","text":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Sultana Afdhal, CEO of WISH, said: “Historically, women have been underrepresented in leadership roles within the global healthcare sector.
