Students matched at internationally renowned medical institutions in the United States including Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Yale-New Haven Hospital, the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. <br>\n <br>\n Of the 34 students of the Class of 2014, 25 sought and secured matches on residency programs in the United States. Two students were accepted to residency programs at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) and seven are pursuing a variety of alternative activities next year. <br>\n <br>\n Match Day marks the culmination of four years of medical training for WCMC-Q&#x2019;s students, who will graduate in May. This year was the first time in the history of WCMC-Q that every single graduating student who applied has secured a US residency place - an extremely rare and coveted achievement for any medical college. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/140324%20English%20WCMC-Q%20students%20celebrate%20record%20residency%20program%20match%20rate.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf86","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcmc-q-students-celebrate-record-residency-program-match-rate","currSlug":"/media-center/wcmc-q-students-celebrate-record-residency-program-match-rate","title":"WCMC-Q Students Celebrate Record Residency Program Match Rate"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
