LHSN is based at Imperial College in London and has partnered with WISH to improve healthcare policy around the world.<br>\n <br>\n In 2013, WISH led a major initiative on the critical issue of patient safety, with a research forum chaired by Dr. Peter Pronovost, Director of The Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality at Johns Hopkins, as well as Johns Hopkins Medicine&#x2019;s Senior Vice President for Patient Safety and Quality. The Network has used that research as a springboard to launch further studies on how different health systems around the world protect patient safety by reducing medical error. Early findings, presented at the Patient Safety Global Action Summit 2016, identified gaps in patient safety for primary care, mental health, and community healthcare. LHSN will present its complete report at WISH&#x2019;s upcoming Summit in November.<br>\n <br>\n WISH is a meeting point for thousands of high-level policymakers, academics, and professionals. It has also evolved into a key platform for the dissemination of healthcare innovation and best practices. The 2016 edition, which will take place from November 29 to 30 in Doha, will feature seven ground-breaking research forums that highlight and address some of the world&#x2019;s most pressing healthcare challenges. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/14%2003%2016_WISH%20London%20PR_En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28qf28","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-presents-ground-breaking-research-on-patient-safety-at-ministerial-summit-in-london","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-presents-ground-breaking-research-on-patient-safety-at-ministerial-summit-in-london","title":"WISH Presents Ground-Breaking Research on Patient Safety at Ministerial Summit in London"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
