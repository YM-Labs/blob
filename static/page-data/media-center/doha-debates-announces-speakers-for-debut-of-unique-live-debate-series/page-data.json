The majority of the debate’s in-person attendees will be students from universities at QF’s Education City, with the audience – including those participating digitally – playing an active role in shaping the debate and solutions.</p>\n<p>Building on the tradition established by Doha Debates since its original launch 14 years ago, the initiative’s new concept features live debates, digital videos, a TV series, blogs and podcasts on the world’s most pressing challenges. This innovative approach includes majlis-style discussions that are designed to bridge differences, build consensus and identify solutions to global issues.</p>\n<p>Amjad Atallah, Managing Director of Doha Debates, emphasized the urgent need to address the global refugee crisis and explained the goals of the debate’s participants, saying: “With more refugees than ever worldwide, we need answers on how best to deal with this crisis. </p>\n<p>“As this live program will show, in a world of increasingly vitriolic arguments, Doha Debates will stand out as a global platform for solution-focused dialogue. This edition of Doha Debates brings together an extraordinary combination of perspectives – refugee, nationalist, internationalist – with a shared goal: agreeing on ways to end this refugee emergency.”</p>\n<p>Participating in the debate will be Muzoon Almellehan, a Syrian refugee, education activist and the youngest-ever UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador; Marc Lamont Hill, a US professor of Media, Cities and Solutions at Temple University, and an activist and award-winning journalist; Douglas Murray, a British author, award-winning journalist and political commentator; and Sanam Naraghi-Anderlini, who will be the debate’s bridge-building ‘connector’ and is the founder and executive director of International Civil Society Action Network – which works to prevent violent extremism by promoting peace, rights and pluralism worldwide – as well as being an adjunct professor at Georgetown University in the US.</p>\n<p>International journalist Ghida Fakhry will moderate the first season's debates, and Nelufar Hedayat – an Afghan refugee, international journalist and documentary-maker – will be the digital host for the debate’s livestreams.</p>\n<p>The new Doha Debates will reach and engage people around the world through a variety of distribution platforms. Doha Debates’ strategic partners include TED, Fortify Rights, Storytegic and Shared_Studios, with its creative contributors including 2017 Oscar nominee Daphne Matziaraki and 2003 Sundance Best Documentary Director and Audience Award winner Jonathan Karsh, whose company is developing a TV program around the core principles of Doha Debates.</p>\n<p>To register to attend the debate, please visit <a href=\"https://www.dohadebates.com/refugees\">www.dohadebates.com/refugees</a>.
