Over the past eight years, about 500 CMU-Q students have taught in Language Bridges to more than 1000 service workers.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Language%20Bridges-%202-24.jpg\" alt=\"Language Bridges- 2.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Silvia Pessoa, associate teaching professor of English at CMU-Q, developed the Language Bridges curriculum almost a decade ago. She noted that while the service workers improve their English language skills, CMU-Q students also learn and grow as they teach the eight-week course. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I&#x2019;m extremely proud of our volunteer students, who demonstrate a great deal of social responsibility and commitment to education,&#x201D; Pessoa said. &#x201C;These students provide a tremendous service to our community.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The president of Language Bridges, Alanood Al-Thani, says that being involved with the program has shaped her career plans. &#x201C;Being a teacher was rewarding because you see first-hand the change and excitement among learners,&#x201D; she explained. &#x201C;I joined the Business Administration Program because I wanted to do something entrepreneurial, and which also involves social responsibility. I have looked into other things, but I keep going back to a career that will have meaning.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n For Basma Mohamed, Language Bridges marked her first teaching experience. &#x201C;I became dedicated to the program and went on to do extra work because I loved seeing the progress that was being made,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;This has been a spectacular experience and I am grateful for this opportunity.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Sara Hussein said her teaching experience enriched her academic journey by pulling her out of her comfort zone. &#x201C;Teaching twice a week helped me learn a lot as an individual, particularly in the two-way exchange between teacher to learner,&#x201D; she explained. &#x201C;I hope to continue and to encourage others to be a part of this program and process.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The Language Bridges program equips workers with basic English language skills.
