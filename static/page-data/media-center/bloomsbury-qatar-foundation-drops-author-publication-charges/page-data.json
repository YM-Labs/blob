However we didn&apos;t want to sit back and take a passive role in this, so we decided to encourage uptake of ORCID by waiving publication fees for accepted articles for those authors who have registered with ORCID&quot;.<br>\n <br>\n ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) provides a non-proprietary alphanumeric code to uniquely identify scientific and scholarly authors. ORCID addresses the problem that a particular author&apos;s contributions to the scientific literature can be hard to discover online as most personal names are not unique and can change (such as with marriage, spelling preferences, transliteration etc.) <br>\n <br>\n ORCID provides a unique and persistent identifier, similar to that created for content-related entities on digital networks by digital object identifiers (DOIs).<br>\n <br>\n Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Journals made this decision to encourage researchers in Qatar and the Middle East to participate in the ORCID initiative. The APC waiver will present authors with the opportunity to experiment with Open Access (OA) publishing and in turn contribute to an increase in OA publications, as well as improving their discoverability through use of a persistent identifier.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/22_02_2014%20Bloomsbury%20QScience%20Connect%20no%20APC_En_FINAL.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2qf30","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/bloomsbury-qatar-foundation-drops-author-publication-charges","currSlug":"/media-center/bloomsbury-qatar-foundation-drops-author-publication-charges","title":"Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Drops Author Publication Charges"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
