Her research identified that targeting these microparticles could be of therapeutic use in treating cancer in the future. Dr Al Thawadi&#x2019;s work was published in the Oncotarget Journal.</p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Also focused on ovarian cancer research, Dr Al Farsi chose a very original approach, including computer simulation, to look at genes that are protected against mutation and to discover pathways that are essential for tumour survival. Her work is in preparation for publication.</p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Both doctors received their degrees from the University of Paris-Sud (Paris 11) in France, while performing their research in collaboration with Weill Cornell Medicine &#x2013; Qatar, a QF partner university.</p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">&#xA0;</p>\n <p style=\"text-align:justify;line-height:normal\" class=\"MsoNormal\">For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/07%2001%202015_QRLPGraduates_PR_En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\n mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:\n Arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;color:blue\">click here</span></u>.</strong></a></p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf53","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qrlp-announces-first-doctors-of-philosophy-in-biomedical-sciences","currSlug":"/media-center/qrlp-announces-first-doctors-of-philosophy-in-biomedical-sciences","title":"QRLP Announces First Doctors of Philosophy in Biomedical Sciences"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
