In addition they will be presented with gardening equipment and a variety of vegetable and herb seeds. <br>\n <br>\n The children will be given advice on how to grow the seeds and they can then watch the plants from germination through to when the vegetables develop.<br>\n <br>\n The children will then be able to take the produce they have grown home and eat the freshest, healthiest food there can be with a competition held at the end of the growing season to determine which greenhouse had the best crop. The scheme will be expanded in coming years to include more schools.<br>\n <img width=\"213\" height=\"128\" alt=\"Greenhouse 2.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Greenhouse%202-8.jpg\"><br>\n His Excellency Mr Abdulla Bin Khalid Al-Qahtani, Minister of Public Health, confirmed that the building of greenhouses in elementary schools in Qatar will be of great help to the Supreme Council of Health and its ongoing efforts to raise awareness of health among the young, especially in the area of healthy eating. <br>\n <br>\n He praised the fruitful cooperation between the Supreme Council of Health, the Supreme Education Council, Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar, and other parties that have supported the initiative. <br>\n <br>\n His Excellency said that the Your Health First campaign, through which the project was developed, serves the National Health Strategy 2011-2016, because raising awareness in people and encouraging them to follow a healthy lifestyle is a huge challenge that requires the combined efforts of everyone involved in it. The campaign is seen as very significant in that respect.<br>\n <br>\n His Excellency pointed out that the spread of unhealthy eating habits has exacerbated health problems and has led to chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, as well as cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer, occurring at an early age. Health surveys undertaken in Qatar in 2012 showed that 41 percent of citizens suffer from obesity and 91.1 percent do not eat the recommended daily allowance of five fruit and vegetables as stated by the World Health Organization. Improving this requires a new strategy to consolidate the efforts in order to create a healthy society.<br>\n <br>\n His Excellency clarified that the Supreme Council of Health has adopted many projects and programs that aim to change unhealthy habits and behaviors. These programs are part of the National Working Plan for Nutrition and Physical Exercise (2011-2016), which aims to reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases and the mortality rates associated with them in accordance with the goals of the National Health Strategy, one facet of which is Preventative Healthcare. <br>\n <img width=\"336\" height=\"255\" alt=\"Greenhouse 16.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Greenhouse%2016-9.jpg\"><br>\n The National Health Strategy also aims to establish a comprehensive program for nutrition and physical exercise with initiatives that target all groups that would benefit so it would ultimately have an effect on the prevalence of obesity&#x2019;. <br>\n His Excellency emphasized that the council is keen to consolidate cooperation with all governmental and non-governmental institutions as they play a vital role in promoting the need to adopt healthy lifestyles that will contribute in creating a healthy, strong and productive society.<br>\n <br>\n The greenhouse initiative was launched at Al Bayan Preparatory School for Girls by WCMC-Q and the college&#x2019;s strategic partners: Qatar Foundation, the Supreme Education Council, Qatar Petroleum, ExxonMobil Qatar Inc., Occidental Petroleum of Qatar, Qatar Olympic Committee and Vodafone Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n His Excellency Dr Mohammed bin Saleh Al-Sada the Minister of Energy and Industry, and Chairman and Managing Director of Qatar Petroleum, praised Sahtak Awalan as an important initiative towards a healthier new generation.<br>\n <br>\n He said: &#x201C;Teaching healthy eating habits is vital to building stronger and healthier bodies and minds for a whole new generation of children surrounded by junk food.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;We hope that by combining education and a fun experience, Sahtak Awalan will help children take their first steps towards healthier living.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n His Excellency Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Secretary General of the Qatar Olympic Committee(QOC), expressed his happiness for the practical steps taken in the frame of the Sahtak Awalan - Your Health First campaign, and in particular, the launching of the first greenhouse within the project. HE reiterated the crucial role that sport plays in raising the health level for all community members, as part of the combined efforts exerted by the various state authorities and public and private institutions to adopt a healthy lifestyle.<br>\n <img width=\"382\" height=\"255\" alt=\"Greenhouse 9.JPG\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Greenhouse%209-9.jpg\"><br>\n In this regard, HE QOC Secretary General said: &#x201C;The QOC was keen to enter into a strategic partnership with Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar so that both institutions coordinate their efforts towards laying a solid foundation for building a healthy society in line with of the Qatar National Vision 2030 where human development represents one of the most important pillars aimed at raising a healthy generation than can actively contribute to building a prosperous future for the State of Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n HE added: &#x201C;The sports sector strategy 2011-2016 aims to raise the level of participation in sports and physical activities, thus meeting the objectives of the Sahtak Awalan - Your Health First campaign.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Engineer Saad Al Muhannadi, President of Qatar Foundation, highlighted the significance of starting the education process early and involving children in the practice of growing healthy food, in order to build a strong foundation for healthy living in the mindset of future generations.<br>\n <br>\n Engineer Al Muhannadi said: &#x201C;At Qatar Foundation, we endeavor to provide all our youth with a lifelong education that will help them grow into healthy and productive adults, since this approach will positively impact their well-being for many years to come. By engaging children in the process of growing nutritious food and learning about it from an early age, we can instil a much deeper understanding of what constitutes healthy eating habits and encourage them to develop an appreciation for nature and healthy living.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Weill Cornell&#x2019;s website, please <a href=\"http://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/media/reports/2013/greenhouse.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf97","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcmc-qs-innovative-greenhouse-project-to-teach-children-about-healthy-eating","currSlug":"/media-center/wcmc-qs-innovative-greenhouse-project-to-teach-children-about-healthy-eating","title":"WCMC-Q’s Innovative Greenhouse Project To Teach Children About Healthy Eating"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
