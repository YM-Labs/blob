This endeavor helps to build a knowledge-based economy by recognizing the talent and capabilities of budding national scientists with a flair for communication. These representatives are essential to improving the public&#x2019;s understanding of science, inspiring the next generation of talented scientists and engineers in Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n More than 65 students, 45 teachers, and 55 researchers applied to take part, attending pre-event communication training. Entrants were then required to participate in two competition heats held at Qatar University and then the headquarters of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/03%2003%2016%20FameLab_En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10qf49","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/national-famelab-finals-to-take-place-at-hbku","currSlug":"/media-center/national-famelab-finals-to-take-place-at-hbku","title":"National FameLab Finals to Take Place at HBKU"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
