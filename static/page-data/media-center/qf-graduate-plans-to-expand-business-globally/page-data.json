With the skills I learned at VCUarts Qatar during my freshman year I was able to plan and strategize my ideas,&#x201D; said Al-Majid, who is graduating from VCUarts Qatar with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Fashion Design. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image2-24.jpg\" alt=\"Image2.png\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Al-Majid, whose main priority so far has been to complete her studies and obtain her degree, believes hard work, dedication, and passion are three components that form the basis of any successful business, and that the time has now come to expand her business internationally. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;My immediate plan following graduation is to take my business, &#x2018;Wrapping Station,&#x2019; to a global level. I want to showcase to the world that wrapping is an art and not just covering gifts with paper or fabric. With the enthusiasm and passion I put into my work, I hope for my business to continue flourishing; it&#x2019;s part of my bigger dream,&#x201D; said Al-Majid.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image3-24.jpg\" alt=\"Image3.jpeg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n &#x201C;When I started my wrapping business, there were hardly any proper wrapping shops in Qatar, but now even flower shops have started to wrap gifts. Competition is what makes people innovative and I look forward to taking my skills and creativity further to show customers that they don&#x2019;t have to settle for anything less,&#x201D; said Al-Majid. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_QF_Convocation_MaryamAl-Majid_Feature_EN_20180501_Clean.pdf\">here</a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17qf35","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qf-graduate-plans-to-expand-business-globally","currSlug":"/media-center/qf-graduate-plans-to-expand-business-globally","title":"QF Graduate Plans to Expand Business Globally"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
