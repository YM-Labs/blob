This includes <em>QScience Connect</em>, the publisher&#x2019;s interdisciplinary journal that covers research from all disciplines considered to be valid, ethical and correct. <br>\n <br>\n The indexed journals, which are published on BQFJ&#x2019;s digital publishing portal <em>QScience.com</em>, include the <em>International Review of Law; QScience Connect; Global Cardiology Science and Practice; Journal of Local and Global Health Science; Journal of Local and Global Health Perspectives; and Journal of Emergency Medicine, Trauma, and Acute Care. </em><br>\n <br>\n Additionally, BQFJ is participating in the RoMEO project, a searchable database of publisher&apos;s policies regarding the self-archiving of journal articles on the web and in Open Access repositories. <br>\n <br>\n Arend Kuester, Managing Director, BQFJ said, &#x201C;Authors that publish in QScience.com journals can archive the pre-print, post-print or published version without any embargo period. However, as self-archiving policies differ by publisher, authors might be confused as what is and what is not allowed. The RoMEO project does an excellent job in helping to clarify this situation and we&#x2019;re pleased to be part of this.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Journals%20Indexed%20Press%20release%20En%20Dr3.pdf\">For the full story, please click here.</a><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf61","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qsciencecom-journals-now-indexed-in-doaj","currSlug":"/media-center/qsciencecom-journals-now-indexed-in-doaj","title":"QScience.com Journals Now Indexed In DOAJ"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
