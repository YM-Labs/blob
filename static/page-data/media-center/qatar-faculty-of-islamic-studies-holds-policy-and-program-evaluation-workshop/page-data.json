The three-day workshop took place at the LAS building at Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s campus last week and was attended by 31 participants. <br>\n <br>\n The workshop concentrated on the key steps in evaluation and introduced participants to logic models, needs assessments and determining evaluation measures, and designing methods and data collection. <br>\n <br>\n Participants worked on a number of case studies, individually and collaboratively analysing several case study programs executed in Qatar, Gulf region and internationally. <br>\n <br>\n The workshop was presented by Dr Leslie Pal, Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor of Public Policy and Administration, and co-Director of the Centre on Governance and Public Management at Carleton University. <br>\n <br>\n Active internationally for several years, Professor Pal has worked with the Civil Service Training and Development Institute of the Government of Hong Kong, training senior civil servants. He has also worked on public sector reform projects in Ukraine, Russia, Armenia, and Georgia. <br>\n <img width=\"258\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/qfis_logo-9.jpg\" alt=\"qfis_logo.jpg\"><br>\n The workshop is aimed at executive trainees and teaches them how to effectively measure the expected outcomes of their organisation, whether it is public, private or non-profit sector, present in Qatar, in the Gulf or internationally. It guides participants on the best way to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the programs during its execution phase and after, and if the program could fulfil its strategic objectives or not. <br>\n <br>\n During the workshop, Dr Pal explained four types of evaluation: Effectiveness evaluation that measures the strategic impact of the program, efficiency evaluation that is based on cost-benefit analysis, process evaluation that studies if procedures and processes follow a logical trend and are well aligned with formal requirements, and finally, utility evaluation that measures performance in terms of perception. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/02_03_2014_QFIS_Policy%20and%20Program%20Evaluation%20PR_English_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf15","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-faculty-of-islamic-studies-holds-policy-and-program-evaluation-workshop","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-faculty-of-islamic-studies-holds-policy-and-program-evaluation-workshop","title":"Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies Holds Policy and Program Evaluation Workshop"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
