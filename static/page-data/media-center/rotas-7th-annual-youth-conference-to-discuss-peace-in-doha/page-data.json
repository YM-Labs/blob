It is the first and largest conference of its kind in Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n The theme for this year&#x2019;s summit focuses on youth development for peaceful societies. The theme also encompasses the summit&#x2019;s core segments, namely personal leadership, service learning and global citizenship.<br>\n <br>\n Members of the Youth Planning Committee have been rigorously trained to interview delegates and empower their peers in order to take the annual event to new heights. The process of interviewing the participants for EMPOWER has already started, with the aim to choose from among 1100 registered youth only 450 to attend the conference <br>\n <img width=\"640\" height=\"265\" alt=\"ROTA single logo.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/ROTA%20single%20logo-17.jpg\"><br>\n Peaceful Societies is the latest in a long line of topics where young leaders will strive to make an impact.
