These were highlighted as recommendations during the closing of the forum.<br>\n <br>\n Some of the most important recommendations include: re-evaluating current policies seeking to balance family and work responsibilities; unifying regulations concerning the arrangements for working mothers, particularly maternity leave; devising a national policy for each GCC state in order to address the challenges facing families; preparing a guideline book; encouraging relevant partnerships to finance different programs seeking to balance family and work responsibilities; and reviewing policies to adopt best practices in early childhood care.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/01%2006%2016%20DIFI%20Forum%20Post%20PR%20EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">click here.</a></strong></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf63","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/difi-hosts-inaugural-annual-family-policy-forum","currSlug":"/media-center/difi-hosts-inaugural-annual-family-policy-forum","title":"DIFI Hosts Inaugural Annual Family Policy Forum"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
