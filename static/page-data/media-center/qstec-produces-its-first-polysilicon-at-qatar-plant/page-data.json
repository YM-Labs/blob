We are now moving from the construction phase towards full scale production and it&#x2019;s an incredibly exciting time for QSTec and the region&#x2019;s solar industry.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The new facility is state of the art including a wide range of environmentally friendly technologies, next generation reactors, energy efficient cooling systems and advanced waste treatment facilities that recycle excess gasses and water for reuse in a closed loop system that reduces costs. In addition to this, QSTec&#x2019;s new facility has a 1.1 megawatt solar installation that includes a ground mounted solar farm as well as rooftop and solar car parking shades and is a showcase of sustainability. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/6-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"568\"><br>\n Today, polysilicon is the key raw material used in 90% of the world&#x2019;s solar modules. To this end, QSTec has made several strategic investments spanning the entire solar value chain, including the largest integrated solar module manufacturer in Europe and the United States of America, SolarWorld AG, as well as the world&#x2019;s leading solar and semi-conductor technology company, Centrotherm AG. As a result, QSTec has emerged as a globally integrated solar company, and together, these companies have formed a solar consortium of excellence with an aim to achieve greater efficiencies right across the solar industry. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/QSTec%20starts%20up%20its%20polysilicon%20facility%20in%20Qatar.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf69","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qstec-produces-its-first-polysilicon-at-qatar-plant","currSlug":"/media-center/qstec-produces-its-first-polysilicon-at-qatar-plant","title":"QSTec Produces its First Polysilicon at Qatar Plant"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
