Radhwan Al Saad, a member of the winning team, said, &#x201C;As undergraduate students, participation in UREP was a very enriching experience for us at an early stage in our careers. The data compiled as part of research is a resource that the country can refer to in future years when they adopt different techniques for oil drilling.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Students from College of the North Atlantic - Qatar won second place for their research on antimicrobial properties of traditional Arab medicinal plants, with students from Virginia Commonwealth University in Qatar taking third place. Qatar University and TAMU-Q students placed fourth and fifth. <br>\n <br>\n The annual competition is a spinoff of QNRF&#x2019;s UREP, which provides students with &#x2018;hands-on&#x2019; experience, under faculty mentorship, as part of the organization&#x2019;s &#x2018;learning by doing&#x2019; approach towards undergraduate research education. Since its inception in 2006, more than 2,000 undergraduate students have taken part in UREP.<br>\n <br>\n Registration for participation in the 14th cycle of UREP opened on 27 March, 2013.
