Researchers have attempted to discover specific genetic traits that make some people more susceptible to PTSD and other anxiety disorders, and have even conceptualized a drug that could &#x2018;turn off&#x2019; parts of the brain to effectively eradicate fear. <br>\n <br>\n Some recent research, however, has acknowledged the limitations of a purely neurobiological approach to understanding PTSD, explained Dr. Sharkey. <br>\n <br>\n The Grand Rounds, developed by WCM-Q&#x2019;s Division of Continuing Professional Development (CPD), provides a platform for expert speakers to engage with healthcare professionals in the community to disseminate knowledge of the latest developments in medical technology, research and best practice. <br>\n &#xA0;<br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160221%20English%20WCM-Q%20Grand%20Rounds%20explores%20the%20healing%20power%20of%20the%20arts.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf93","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-grand-rounds-explores-the-healing-power-of-the-arts","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-grand-rounds-explores-the-healing-power-of-the-arts","title":"WCM-Q Grand Rounds Explores the Healing Power of the Arts"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
