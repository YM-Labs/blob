The findings were published in the journal Natureon 2 June 2013<br>\n <br>\n The authors suggest that these findings may have implications for cancer treatment, since cancers use regulatory T cells to prevent their own destruction by antitumor immune responses. The team is now working toward manipulating the activity of the Bach2 gene with the goal of developing a new cancer immunotherapy. As this study was conducted in mice, it must be replicated in humans before its findings can be applied in a clinical setting.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Sidra Medical and Research Center will continue along this line of research through direct collaboration with the <a href=\"http://www.nih.gov/\">National Institutes of Health </a>(NIH) to extend this observation toward its practical application to modulate the outcome of immune diseases by genetically regulating the function of Bach2 or other factors that regulate immune cell function,&#x201D; said Marincola, who was involved in the study. <br>\n <br>\n Sidra plans to develop a facility where reprogrammable cell therapy can be conducted. A delegation led by David F Stroncek, MD, Chief of the Cell Processing Section at the NIH will visit Sidra in June to begin discussing future collaboration in the creation of a reprogrammable cellular therapy facility, which will become a resource for Sidra&#x2019;s local, regional and international partners and collaborators.<br>\n <br>\n In autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks normal cells and tissues in the body that are generally recognized as &#x2019;self&#x2018; and do not usually trigger immune responses in patients without autoimmune diseases. Autoimmunity can arise as a consequence of abnormal immune responses in infectious diseases and cancer. <br>\n <br>\n One of the hallmarks of uncontrolled immune responses is excessive tissue inflammation. Although tissue inflammation is a normal part of immune responses, excessive inflammation can lead to tissue and organ damage and may be potentially lethal. How CD4+ T cells become either activating/inflammatory or regulatory is not well understood, according to the researchers.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full story please visit <a href=\"http://www.sidra.org/en/News/index\">http://www.sidra.org/en/News/index </a><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf15","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/possible-new-cancer-therapies-being-examined","currSlug":"/media-center/possible-new-cancer-therapies-being-examined","title":"Possible New Cancer Therapies Being Examined"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
