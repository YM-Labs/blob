Researchers will apply these skills to diagnostics and precision medicine to address health issues that prevail among the Qatari population. <br>\n <img width=\"285\" height=\"250\" alt=\"null\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/sox17_sox2_arg-Stem%20Cell-2.jpg\"><br>\n The partnership&#x2019;s first project will focus on breast cancer, the most common form of cancer in Qatar, and will be conducted in collaboration with researchers from Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC).<br>\n <br>\n QBRI and RIKEN-PMI will address the possibility of implementing the biomarker discovery project utilizing RIKEN&#x2019;s genomic technology to identify disease signatures. The project will include a joint research laboratory for molecular diagnostics in Qatar, which will enable researchers to discover new biomarkers and develop personalized preventive medical solutions. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/04.01.2015%20QBRI-RIKEN%20PR-En.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf85","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-biomedical-research-institute-to-set-up-joint-research-laboratories-and-programs-with-leading-japanese-institute-riken","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-biomedical-research-institute-to-set-up-joint-research-laboratories-and-programs-with-leading-japanese-institute-riken","title":"Qatar Biomedical Research Institute to Set Up Joint Research Laboratories and Programs with Leading Japanese Institute Riken"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
