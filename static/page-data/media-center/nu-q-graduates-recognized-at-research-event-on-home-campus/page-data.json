Dennis, dean and CEO at NU-Q.<br>\nShakeeb Asrar presented on his project, “Sensationalism in Pakistani News Channels: A Downside of Media Deregulation?” which investigated the dramatization of news in Pakistan, linking it to the deregulation/liberalization of the media in 2002. His work received the Best Panel Presentation for Global Challenges and Connections, and he was awarded the third best research presentation overall. <br>\n<br>\nAsrar was mentored by NU-Q Professor Joe Khalil, who is a seasoned global media professional, and expert in TV production and programming. <br>\n<br>\n“It was really interesting to study what I had been witnessing in Pakistan for years, and it was also eye-opening to research how news channels operate in Pakistan, since I wasn't aware of back-end operations such as media ownership, news gathering, professional background of news anchors, and so forth,” said Asrar. <br>\n<br>\nJemina Legaspi’s presentation, \"Different Perceptions of Audiences, Organizers, and Scientists in Public Science Majlis Forum in Qatar,” explored the question of whether the public in Qatar has a deficit understanding of science. Her topic is one segment of a larger UREP research project she is working on alongside fellow student researchers Aisha Al Qadi and Sara Al Ansari, and is being led by NU-Q Professor Anto Mohsin. <br>\n<br>\nThe annual expo on the home campus serves as a platform for the global Northwestern community to present their research projects, whether they are performed on stage, written in a thesis, or produced in a lab. Participants at the expo presented their work through poster and oral presentations in the arts, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.<br></p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf31","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-graduates-recognized-at-research-event-on-home-campus","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-graduates-recognized-at-research-event-on-home-campus","title":"NU-Q Graduates Recognized at Research Event on Home Campus"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
