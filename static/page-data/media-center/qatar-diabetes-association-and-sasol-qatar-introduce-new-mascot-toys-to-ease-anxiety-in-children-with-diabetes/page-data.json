Mascots Salem and Sarah have clear injection sites on their arms, legs, and stomach. <br>\n <br>\n Around 1,000 plush toys will be used in QDA camps for children with diabetes, as well as distributed through the Newly Diagnosed Programme in collaboration with Hamad Medical Corporation. <br>\n <br>\n Around 16.7 per cent of Qatar&#x2019;s total adult native population suffers from diabetes with 23.11 per 100,000 children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, according to data from Hamad Medical Corporation.
