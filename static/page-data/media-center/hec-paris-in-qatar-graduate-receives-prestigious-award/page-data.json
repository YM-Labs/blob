Syed Zuhair Naqvi, an EMBA alumnus from the Doha campus, received some of the recognition this year.<br>\n <br>\n Having a career spanning more than 20-years across various industries, Naqvi was praised for initiating plans to launch The Mishaall Foundation, a social enterprise for the exchange of high-quality, life changing mentorship between thousands of underprivileged mentees in Pakistan and willing mentors throughout the world. <br>\n <br>\n Over five years, it will spend USD 1.0 million and create a cumulative Monetized Social Value (MSV) of over USD 5.5 million by providing mentorship to over 5,000 15-28-year olds. As of its 60th month of operations, The Foundation will be facilitating 1,000 simultaneous mentorship pairings, creating a monthly MSV of over USD 200,000, translating into a Social Return on Investment (SROI) of over 1,000%.<br>\n <br>\n Mishaall will be the only nationwide mentoring platform in Pakistan giving mentees the opportunity to learn and mentors the opportunity to &#x201C;give back&#x201D; in a way that not only results in a great deal of self-development through sharing and listening, but also in a multitude of benefits from being part of a growing, global family of successful and caring professionals. In this way, Mishaall&#x2019;s sponsors will gain a credible, professionally run channel to promote their philanthropic objectives.<br>\n <br>\n Commenting on his achievement, Syed Zuhair Naqvi, said: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m truly grateful to my professors at HEC Paris who guided and inspired me to conceive The Mishaall Foundation as my Capstone Project, which is the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.&#x201D;<br>\n HEC Paris in Qatar offers a number of Executive Education programs from its campus in Doha led by experienced professors and mentors, with alumni from a plectrum of sectors across the region.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/HEC%20Paris_ENG.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8qf25","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hec-paris-in-qatar-graduate-receives-prestigious-award","currSlug":"/media-center/hec-paris-in-qatar-graduate-receives-prestigious-award","title":"HEC Paris in Qatar Graduate Receives Prestigious Award"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
