Just as it is important for the mother to take care of her physical health and that of her baby&#x2019;s &#x2013; it is equally important that she cares for her emotional health. Mental health issues are common during this period and the right support and treatment can have a lasting positive impact on the mother, infant, and the entire family. Our women&#x2019;s mental healthcare team will provide culturally sensitive, woman and family centered support and treatment during this important time.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n As the only comprehensive perinatal mental health services in the country, the Sidra Women&#x2019;s Perinatal Mental Healthcare Clinic will receive referrals from Sidra&#x2019;s Obstetrics Clinic, Hamad Medical Corporation and Primary Health Care Corporation.
