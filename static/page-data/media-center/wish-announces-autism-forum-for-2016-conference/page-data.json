Raising awareness and enhancing knowledge of the condition by understanding the cultural needs and barriers to best practices, for example, will facilitate treatment and the development of educational curricula. <br>\n <br>\n The report will recommend that interdisciplinary training spans sectors, with providers, teachers, and families working together to ensure best treatment for the individual at the earliest stages possible. In the home, modifications can be made with respect to services offered and equipment requested, along with counseling and education. <br>\n <br>\n The WISH 2016 Summit will feature seven groundbreaking research forums that highlight and address some of the world&#x2019;s most pressing healthcare challenges.
