The film highlights the importance of books and how libraries are the heart of peoples&#x2019; cultural identity and repositories for history and memory.<br>\n <br>\n The event, held at QF&#x2019;s Hamad bin Khalifa University&#x2019;s Student Centre Cinema, featured an informal talk by Dr Mustafa Jahic, Director of the Gazi Husrav Beg Library, and a member of the group that saved the library&#x2019;s manuscripts.<br>\n <br>\n A book discussion of Amjad Nasser&#x2019;s &#x2018;<em>Land of No Rain</em>&#x2019; was another activity created to engage the public. The book highlights the story of Younis al-Khattat, a fictional character, who has lived in exile for 20 years, and who later returns to Hamiya, his fictional Arab country. On his return to his homeland, Younis al-Khattat reconnects with family and friends he left behind 20 years ago, but he mostly struggles with his past and old self. <br>\n <br>\n In addition to cultural and educational activities, QNL also offered training sessions on the use of online resources offered by the library. <br>\n <br>\n A series of interactive and practical training sessions helped residents familiarize themselves with selected online resources in Humanities: OverDrive, JSTOR, OneClickDigital, Zinio and Cengage Collection. <br>\n <br>\n The &apos;OverDrive&apos; online resource provides popular eBooks for most devices. The &apos;JSTOR&apos; database includes more than 1,500 leading academic journals in humanities, social sciences, and sciences. <br>\n <br>\n Training sessions also focused on the &#x2018;OneClickDigital&apos; database, an English digital audio-book database that allows users to download audio-books, and &#x2018;Zinio&#x2019; database, which provides access to the full version of several hundred popular magazines. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/01-12-14-QF%20QNL%20November%20Activities%20PR-En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</strong><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15qf11","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-national-library-hails-successful-month-of-exciting-activities-promoting-community-engagement","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-national-library-hails-successful-month-of-exciting-activities-promoting-community-engagement","title":"Qatar National Library Hails Successful Month of Exciting Activities Promoting Community Engagement"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
