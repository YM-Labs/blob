Each of us must decide how we live together. How we define ourselves and others. <br>\n <br>\n We can retrench to narrow definitions of identity and labels, or we can seek out the global values and principles that we all share as human beings.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Prince Charles thanked Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser and Qatar Foundation for their continued support as an outcome of the MOU that was signed in June with the Prince of Wales Foundation. <br>\n <br>\n The Qatar UK 2013 Year of Culture will see several more activities held in the coming months to further develop and build upon Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s relationship with UK entities.
