The initiative enables the migrant workers to develop their ability to effectively communicate at a basic level in English in their daily activities.<br>\n <br>\n The program which started on 6 September 2014 will take place over a 16-week period that is split into two terms. The first term, which began on 6 September, will last for eight consecutive weeks, while the second term will start in February 2015.<br>\n <br>\n This year, over 120 volunteers from the Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s branch campus universities, Ashgal, and ROTA, are entrusted with the task of helping low-skilled workers improve their English language skills. <br>\n <br>\n The RAEL Program provides both an educational opportunity for workers who may have had limited schooling in their own countries, and a valuable service learning opportunity for the students and volunteers who will gain new teaching skills along with an understanding of different communities and their needs. <br>\n <br>\n The training course will cover a variety of topics to support the student volunteers in becoming fully-fledged Literacy Trainers. The topics covered in the training will include teaching and learning, communication, and understanding the overall context of global migration. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/14-9-14RAELtrainingrelease.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf96","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/over-120-volunteers-to-educate-migrant-workers-through-rotas-adult-english-literacy-program","currSlug":"/media-center/over-120-volunteers-to-educate-migrant-workers-through-rotas-adult-english-literacy-program","title":"Over 120 Volunteers to Educate Migrant Workers Through ROTA’S Adult English Literacy Program"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
