It is estimated that more than 150 million people around the world use metformin every day. <br>\n <br>\n In type-2 diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin or the body&#x2019;s cells do not respond adequately to insulin, which is responsible for controlling blood sugar levels. Metformin is an oral medication that helps to keep blood sugar levels under control by improving insulin sensitivity. <br>\n <br>\n Speaking at WCM-Q to an audience of fellow health professionals, Dr. Triggle said: &#x201C;Metformin is the &#x2018;first choice&#x2019; medication for treatment of type-2 diabetes because it is very effective, it is very inexpensive, and its side-effects are generally not severe. Indeed, there is evidence that suggests metformin may actually have some beneficial side-effects, such as anti-aging and anti-cancer properties, as well as protecting against cardiovascular disease.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Studies of stype-2 diabetes patients receiving metformin showed a statistically significant reduced incidence of cancer and improved survival rates among those who did get cancer. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Triggle explained that the beneficial side-effects of the drug appeared to be related to its capacity to affect the function of the body&#x2019;s endothelial cells, which line the interior surfaces of blood vessels. The endothelial cells play a key role in supporting the growth of new blood vessels in tumors, and metformin appears to interfere with this process. Dr. Triggle also spoke about some of his own research into a protein called Sirtuin 1, which is encoded by a gene called SIRT1 known to be involved in the aging process. Metformin appears to interact with the SIRT1 gene and interrupt the aging process. This interaction also appears to slow the deterioration of the cardiovascular system. <br>\n <br>\n Research conducted in Dr. Triggle&#x2019;s laboratory at WCM-Q has been published in some of the world&#x2019;s most important medical journals, including the British Journal of Pharmacology. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170328%20English%20WCM-Q%20Grand%20Rounds%20explores%20anti-cancer%20side-effects%20of%20diabetes%20drug.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf35","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-series-explores-anti-cancer-side-effects-of-diabetes-drug","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-series-explores-anti-cancer-side-effects-of-diabetes-drug","title":"WCM-Q Series Explores Anti-Cancer Side-Effects of Diabetes Drug"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
