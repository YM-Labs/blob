The call also aims to support research into the correlation between disease phenotype and genotype, allowing findings to be translated into medical products, and leading to advancements in healthcare and a wider understanding of personalized medicine among Qatar&#x2019;s healthcare providers and wider community.<br>\n <br>\n Under the second cycle of the PPM, three new specific research priority areas &#x2013; discovery; clinical and translational research; and community engagement, ethics and policy in precision medicine &#x2013; will be focused upon.<br>\n <br>\n One of the region&#x2019;s major national genome programs, QGP &#x2013; a population-based initiative using specimen and population samples gathered by QBB &#x2013; is currently in its pilot phase. Its goal is to improve healthcare, encourage cutting-edge genomic research and innovation, and integrate genomics, as well as other &#x2018;omics&#x2019; technologies into medical and research practices through building research networks across Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n Each PPM award is for up to three years. Researchers who are affiliated with an institution in Qatar, and who have a research-oriented doctorate or any of the approved terminal degrees and at least five peer-reviewed publications, are eligible to apply as lead principal investigators. The deadline for submission of applications is midday on March 8, 2017. <br>\n <br>\n To register and submit a full application through the online submission system, visit <a href=\"https://www.qgrants.org/\">https://www.qgrants.org/.</a><br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD-EC-QNRF%20QGP-PR-EN-2017%2002%2020.pdf\">here</a></strong>.</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf17","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qnrf-and-qgp-rerun-path-towards-personalized-medicine","currSlug":"/media-center/qnrf-and-qgp-rerun-path-towards-personalized-medicine","title":"QNRF and QGP Rerun 'Path Towards Personalized Medicine'"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
