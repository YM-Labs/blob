In Qatar, we&#x2019;ve already seen what this makes possible,&#x201D; Her Excellency Sheikha Hind said.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;But globally, education has not experienced a truly major transformation in my lifetime &#xAC;&#x2013; a lifetime that has seen the cutting-edge of technology go from fax machines, to personal computers, to mobile and nanotechnology. Education, rather than remaining earthbound, has to make the sort of quantum leap that technology and communication have made many times in a single generation.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Her Excellency Sheikha Hind was joined in speaking at the session by Esteban Moctezuma, Secretary of Public Education, Mexico; Prof. Dr. Alexander Lorz, Minister of Education, Ministry of Education, State of Hesse, Germany; and Commissioner J. Prospero E. De Vera III, Officer-in-Charge, Commission on Higher Education, Republic of the Philippines.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image3-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image3.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n Innovation is at the heart of the ecosystem of education built by QF, which spans the full spectrum of learning from pre-school and K-12 education to undergraduate and postgraduate study. The academic template pioneered by QF&#x2019;s Qatar Academy model ensures pre-university students receive an education that is both international-standard and grounded in the Arabic language and cultural identity. Meanwhile, QF&#x2019;s investment in personalized, inclusive learning has seen it develop a number of specialized schools, designed to help every student achieve their full potential.<br>\n <br>\n Through its &#x2018;multiversity&#x2019; model &#x2013; where multiple higher education institutions are integrated within a single location, Education City &#x2013; QF gives its students the unique opportunity to cross-register for classes at different partner universities, extending and enhancing their learning experience. QF has also created a culture of multidimensional learning, as the proximity of its schools and universities to its hubs of research and innovation enables hands-on learning and access to expertise, equipping students for the workforce of the future and to make the greatest contribution to society.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf93","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/he-sheikha-hind-speaks-at-the-education-world-forum-in-london","currSlug":"/media-center/he-sheikha-hind-speaks-at-the-education-world-forum-in-london","title":"HE Sheikha Hind Speaks at The Education World Forum in London"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
