I&#x2019;ll explain why President Obama sees the region this way &#x2013; a wasting asset &#x2013; and seeks to create a new containment policy in the Middle East.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n He described the President&#x2019;s worldview as one that seeks to limit engagement and risks in his Middle East foreign policy agenda, as increasingly complex domestic issues present further distractions. He concludes that the President should re-launch his foreign policy efforts with an eye to approaching regional issues through a more strategic global agenda, one in which the cup, or opportunity for positive outcomes, is half full instead of empty.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;To see this university putting forward the commonality of human experience, in teaching studying living here, you all live part of that global change. I speak to you as a historical optimist, something that has supplied my own &#x2018;glass is half full&#x2019; frame of reference,&#x201D; concluded the respected journalist.<br>\n <br>\n Reporting from Kenya, Hoagland won the first of his two Pulitzer Prizes for covering the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa in 1971, resulting in the apartheid government&#x2019;s banning him from entering the country. <br>\n <br>\n He won his second Pulitzer Prize in 1991 for covering the events that led up to the Gulf War, and the failures of Gorbachev&#x2019;s leadership. Hoagland continues to work at <em>The Washington Post</em> as Contributing Editor.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Georgetown&apos;s website, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/421789.html#\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf68","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/the-glass-half-empty-barack-obama-and-the-middle-east","currSlug":"/media-center/the-glass-half-empty-barack-obama-and-the-middle-east","title":"The Glass Half-Empty: Barack Obama and the Middle East"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
