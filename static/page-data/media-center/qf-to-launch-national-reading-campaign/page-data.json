Through a series of innovative and interactive projects, the nationwide initiative will make books readily accessible to the people of Qatar, and encourage their uptake.<br>\n <br>\n Other QF initiatives, such as the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) and Qatar National Library (QNL), further illustrate this goal and, through the National Reading Campaign, the Foundation aims to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge for all. <br>\n <img alt=\"Image 2.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.qf.com.qa/app/media/46173\"><br>\n The first stage of the year-round National Reading Campaign, focusing on schoolchildren across Qatar, is already underway. Regular reading sessions are taking place at many local schools, in coordination with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, to help engender a love of reading from an early age. <br>\n <br>\n A dynamic schedule of activities and events will be launched in the months ahead, each of them designed to demonstrate that reading can be fun, exciting and informative. These include the Reading Truck, which is a dedicated vehicle that will operate as a mobile library; Vending Machines, which will be circulated around schools and allow children to exchange up to ten books at a time; and interactive, immersive story telling sessions and nationwide competitions. And, as the initiative gathers momentum, more activities and events will be announced, each of them positioned to make reading an essential part of the nation&#x2019;s daily routine.<br>\n <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/09%2004%2016%20QF%20National%20Reading%20Campaign%20Launch_PR_En.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf2","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qf-to-launch-national-reading-campaign","currSlug":"/media-center/qf-to-launch-national-reading-campaign","title":"QF to Launch National Reading Campaign"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
