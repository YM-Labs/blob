Participants take on roles as diplomats, discuss and debate international issues, and then develop solutions to the challenges facing the global community through imitation sessions of UN committees, such as the Security Council or the General Assembly. <br>\n <br>\n The ceremony was officially opened with the Flags Procession led by participating student delegations, with the welcome address given by THIMUN Qatar Secretary General, Mr. Ahmed Al Hajari. The opening ceremony was also attended by a number of ambassadors and United Nations diplomats. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image1-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image1.JPG\" width=\"640\" height=\"285\"><br>\n Commenting on the conference, H.E. Bahia Tahzib-Lie, Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Qatar, said: &#x201C;THIMUN Qatar is a fantastic event where students are taught leadership qualities and given the opportunity to openly practice those qualities. It&#x2019;s superb training from where to experience what the UN is about, and to contribute actively and offer fresh solutions.&quot;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The UN is the only legitimate worldwide platform where countries can meet to reach solutions to global issues. These students learn how to give and take, and how to build coalition. The conference is also wonderfully organized which is reflected in the fact there are so many countries represented at what is the biggest MUN in the Middle East.&quot;<br>\n <br>\n THIMUN Qatar Regional Office was created as a joint project between QF&#x2019;s Qatar Academy schools and the THIMUN Foundation, an affiliation program designed to develop high quality MUN conferences throughout the world. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please clcik <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD-EC-THIMUN%20Conference%20En%202017%2001%2025.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23qf80","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/thimun-qatar-2017-conference-opens","currSlug":"/media-center/thimun-qatar-2017-conference-opens","title":"THIMUN Qatar 2017 Conference Opens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
