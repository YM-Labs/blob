Among these obstacles he mentioned: the lack of the sense of practicality, the absence of a clear definition of the concepts of &#x2018;Shari&#x2019;a&#x2019; and &#x2018;application of Shari&#x2019;a&#x2019;. He said that Muslims need to have a clear theory of religion that reflects the comprehensiveness of Islam, to overcome the dualism between divine law and human law, and to develop a clear distinction between the two aspects of morality and legality in Shari&#x2019;a.<br>\n <br>\n The lecture had a large audience, and was concluded with questions on the ethical and jurisprudential challenges that reflect the state of moral and intellectual anxieties brought about by the Arab Spring. <br>\n <br>\n This lecture is part of a series of public events organized by CILE that are planned throughout the academic year. Each lecture will focus on one of several disciplines covered by CILE research work, including: economics, politics, arts, media, environment, bioethics, psychology, methodology and gender studies. By organizing such events, CILE seeks to bring together a group of top-notch experts and scholars of text and context to deepen discussion of legal and ethical issues and provide ethical approaches and solutions.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf26","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/prominent-islamic-scholar-emphasizes-harmony-between-freedom-and-sharia","currSlug":"/media-center/prominent-islamic-scholar-emphasizes-harmony-between-freedom-and-sharia","title":"Prominent Islamic Scholar Emphasizes Harmony Between Freedom And Shari’a"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
