However, what if it is during these periods of transition that we are presented with the most profound and enlightening experiences.&#x201D; <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/3-17.jpg\" alt=\"3.JPG\" height=\"397\" width=\"640\"><br>\n QA alumna Lulwa Al Darwish, who graduated in 2012, returned as this year&#x2019;s guest speaker and reflected on her journey. &#x201C;I grew up in this school, and the desire to give back to my society grew in me. I graduated in 2012, and, because of my teachers and Qatar Academy&#x2019;s inspiring efforts through education &#x2013; one&#x2019;s most powerful weapon &#x2013; I chose to become a special needs educator. Specifically, for individuals with autism, so thank you.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n This year&#x2019;s valedictorian, Ghada Khalifa Al Thani, gave an emotional speech: &#x201C;One individual cannot make a permanent change or development,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It requires the whole community to work together to achieve this. It is useless to believe that one person can do everything on their own; it requires the effort of the entire community. I am proud of all those present with me tonight, and I am sure that you are all proud too.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Commenting on Qatar Academy Doha&#x2019;s 17th Graduation Ceremony, Ms. Buthaina Ali Al Nuaimi, President of PUE, QF, said: &#x201C;Since it was founded in 1996 by His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Father Emir, and Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Chairperson of Qatar Foundation, Qatar Academy Doha has provided comprehensive and internationally recognized academic programs. The school aims to create graduates who are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to serve the local community.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_QADGraduation2017_PressRelease_EN_20170524.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf37","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qad-celebrates-class-of-2017","currSlug":"/media-center/qad-celebrates-class-of-2017","title":"QAD Celebrates Class Of 2017"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
