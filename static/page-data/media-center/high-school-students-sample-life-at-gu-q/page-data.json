For three weeks during their school holidays, the students attended full time academic classes at Georgetown University in Qatar (GU-Q) and took part in a number of fun and educational activities on and off campus. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/ZO9A9604-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n The program, which is run by current GU-Q students and staff, attracts students who seek a competitive edge in the university application process during their final years of high school. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;GPS is a summer program where we bring students from all over the country &#x2013; from all different schools, and all different backgrounds &#x2013; and they all get to have classes,&#x201D; explained GPS peer tutor Lina Noureldin (SFS &#x2019;20). &#x201C;GPS provides them with a pathway into university.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n In addition to helping students prepare for the standardized tests required for university admission, the program&#x2019;s busy schedule included classes in English, math, and international affairs. This helped students improve their knowledge and skills, while introducing them to popular subjects at GU-Q, such as politics and economics. The program also included a number of extracurricular activities and a field trip to the Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art for a fast-paced scavenger hunt. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I am passionate about politics and international relations, so stimulating my mind over the summer and discussing these topics with people who know about it interested me,&#x201D; said GPS participant Abdulla Al-Rumaihi. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been even better than I expected. It was a perfect balance between fun and educational.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n GPS is one of a number of programs at GU-Q designed to make help students gain experience developing and practicing the academic and personal skills necessary for university-level success. Other programs include Planet Georgetown (a year-long workshop series), and A Day in the Life of a Georgetown Student, which gives prospective applicants an inside look into the student experience at GU-Q, including a campus tour and sample lectures. <br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9qf12","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/high-school-students-sample-life-at-gu-q","currSlug":"/media-center/high-school-students-sample-life-at-gu-q","title":"High School Students Sample Life at GU-Q"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
