Over a third of Internet users surveyed said they worry about governments checking what they do on the Internet. <br>\n <br>\n According to the report, &#x201C;The implied concern [of governments checking what they do online] is fairly consistent in almost all countries covered, but more acute in Saudi Arabia, where the majority (53 percent) of those surveyed expressed this concern.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The study &#x2013; titled &#x2018;Media Use in the Middle East - An Eight-Nation Survey&#x2019; - was undertaken by researchers at NU-Q to better understand how people in the region use the Internet and other media. It comes as the university moves towards a more formalized research agenda and is the first in what will be a series of reports relating to Internet use. <br>\n <br>\n The survey includes a specific chapter on Qatar, the only country where those surveyed regarded the Internet as a more important source of news than television. &#x201C;We took an especially close look at media use in the State of Qatar - a country with one of the highest Internet penetration rates in the Arab world&#x2014;and internationally,&#x201D; said Dean and CEO of NU-Q, Everette Dennis.<br>\n <br>\n These findings follow a preliminary report NU-Q released last April that showed web users in the Middle East support the freedom to express opinions online, but they also believe the Internet should be more tightly regulated. <br>\n <br>\n Dennis explained, &#x201C;While this may seem a puzzling paradox, it has not been uncommon for people the world over to support freedom in the abstract but less so in practice.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The results of the survey, conducted in collaboration with Harris Interactive, were released on June 18th at the International Communication Association (ICA) Conference in London .
