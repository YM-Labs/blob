To honor the occasion, QF, alongside a number of QF centers including the Qur&#x2019;anic Botanic Garden (QBG) and Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI), will organize a series of educational games and cultural activities. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Ramadan is a wonderful opportunity for the community to come together as one, and we are delighted to be able to facilitate this through our activities at Education City,&#x201D; said Mrs. Machaille Al-Naimi, President of Community Development, QF. &#x201C;Our schedule of events runs through the whole month, and is open to all ages and nationalities &#x2013; there truly is something for everyone.&#x201D; <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Garangao%20Nights_17Jun16_ALX_7445-17.jpg\" alt=\"Garangao Nights_17Jun16_ALX_7445.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"640\"><br>\n This year, QF&#x2019;s activities aim to reflect four key values &#x2013; mercy, honesty, generosity, and tolerance &#x2013; and help to promote good moral behavior among members of the community.
