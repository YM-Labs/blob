The trip was part of the regular programme of overseas trips and placements that UCL Qatar provides to help educate and develop Qatar&#x2019;s future knowledge and information management workforce. <br>\n <br>\n The visitors also attended the 24th Annual Conference and Exhibition of the Special Libraries Association - Arabian Gulf Chapter (SLA AGC), which attracted over 500 participants. This year&#x2019;s SLA AGC focused on data management and big data, a topic that students at UCL Qatar are taught about during their MA studies. <br>\n <br>\n Successful UCL Qatar alumni, now working in senior positions in Qatar such as Samia Al Shiba, Director of the Library of&#xA0;Qatar University and Milan Vaisljevic, Head of Electronic Resources &amp; Licensing at Qatar National Library, ensured that the Education City-based university had a big presence at the Conference. Samia and Milan are just some of the many former UCL Qatar students now contributing to a vibrant library sector in Qatar.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/picture%201-24.jpg\" alt=\"picture 1.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Discussing the importance of overseas trips during higher education, Milena Dobreva, Senior Lecturer in Library and Information Studies at UCL Qatar, said: &#x201C;The trip to Oman was a great experience for students, helping them to understand the importance of Library and Information Studies in the region and think about its role in the developments of preserving the history of the Gulf. This opportunity was especially beneficial since UCL Qatar will hold a conference on Research Data Management in Digital Humanities on the 17th and 18th of April and offer various courses on the topic of data management and archives this year.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Aisha Al Abdulla, a second-year student said: &#x201C;The hospitality of Oman has been outstanding as we visited the National Records and Archives Authority to explore the different techniques used to restore, preserve, and digitise documents. The highlight of this trip in my opinion was visiting their special collections department and the incredible permanent exhibition that displayed among other items Qur&#x2019;an verses on a camel shoulder bone!&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read more, click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180311%20UCL%20Qatar%20student%20trip%20to%20Oman.pdf\">here</a>.&#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24qf40","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/ucl-qatar-students-visit-oman-on-cultural-exchange","currSlug":"/media-center/ucl-qatar-students-visit-oman-on-cultural-exchange","title":"UCL Qatar Students visit Oman on Cultural Exchange"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
