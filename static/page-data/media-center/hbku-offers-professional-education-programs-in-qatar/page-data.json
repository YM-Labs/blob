More recently, EEC has worked with the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science, and Community Development (QF) Board Management Office and added another recent highlight to its growing list of professional offerings &#x2013; the Board Secretary Basics training. <br>\n <br>\n Speaking on the learning objectives of the specially-tailored course, Rodolphe Boughaba, executive director of EEC, said: &#x201C;The program structure was designed to target professional development and equip practicing and prospective secretaries with all required tools for managing their board or committee.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/003-24.jpg\" alt=\"003.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n An effective board secretary is ultimately vital as the custodian of an organization&#x2019;s accurate documentation records, which in turn translates into bigger questions of confidentiality and compliance. This is why we made sure to cover a full range of topics from compliance issues to common concerns and practices the participants can expect to face in their professional lives. This high-level program sets the stage for subsequent programs with detailed focus on each of the covered topics.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Owing to its successful pilot round, EEC is now planning to re-launch the course in 2019, making it available to self-driven individuals as well as local businesses and organizations that are interested in an exclusive course delivery for their employees.<br>\n <br>\n Beyond national security implications, cybersecurity&#x2019;s growing economic importance as a field is evidenced by the gradual shift in corporate asset structures. With a global emphasis towards digitalization, a trend that is also followed by Qatar, intellectual property (IP) and other intangibles on average now make up a company&#x2019;s majority volume. As a result, Qatar&#x2019;s market economics are projected to increasingly depend on current intellectual, educational, and financial investments in cybersecurity. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180522%20-%20EEC%20Programs%20-%20EN.pdf\">here</a>.<br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf87","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-offers-professional-education-programs-in-qatar","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-offers-professional-education-programs-in-qatar","title":"HBKU Offers Professional Education Programs in Qatar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
