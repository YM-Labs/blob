It will also delve into the scope of implementing an accountable healthcare plan, including the identification of a suitable cohort in Qatar for a pilot study. The study will involve a pool of people aged 18 and older who have been diagnosed with type-2 diabetes or pre-diabetes, and those who are at high risk of developing the disease. <br>\n <br>\n Conference participants will receive detailed action plans and recommendations, which will include the process of identifying the above mentioned cohort; the singling out of individuals within the group who suffer from diabetes; a screening plan for the remaining subjects; the development of a care pathway; the establishment of a multi-disciplinary team to manage patient care; and finally, individualized healthcare plans and project monitoring. <br>\n <br>\n Six months after the study has commenced, a formal stocktake will be announced. This will be followed by a discussion of potentially extending the pilot study to additional populations and areas, depending on the success of the research.<br>\n <br>\n The Brookings Institution and Qatar Diabetes Association (QDA) will have representatives at the forum to provide their unique analysis and advice on this critical topic. The forum will also serve as a platform to examine the potential for Qatar to lead the global community in the development of the healthcare services sector to ensure the prevention of chronic disease complications by way of tailor-made care. <br>\n <br>\n The WISH 2016 Summit will feature seven groundbreaking research forums that highlight and address some of the world&#x2019;s most pressing health-care challenges. <br>\n &#xA0;<br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/07%2004%2016%20WISH%20Accountable%20Care%20Forum%20PR_En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf86","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-announces-accountable-care-forum-and-report-for-2016-conference","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-announces-accountable-care-forum-and-report-for-2016-conference","title":"WISH Announces Accountable Care Forum and Report for 2016 Conference"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
