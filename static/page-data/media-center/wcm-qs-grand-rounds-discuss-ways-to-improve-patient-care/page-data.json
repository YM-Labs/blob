Peter Kaboli, is Chief of Medicine at the Iowa City VA Healthcare System and Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine.</p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said: &#x201C;When I first became involved in quality improvement in hospitals, I felt there was a tension between those who demanded changes be made quickly &#x2013; the &#x2018;get it done by next Tuesday&#x2019; group &#x2013; and those who favored a research-based approach that often took so long that the impetus for change had passed by the time the results were returned.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The key for making real improvements to the quality of care is to eliminate the disconnect between decisive action and rigorous research. Quality improvement measures need to be based on rigorous research that are translated into clear recommendations and strategies, which are then implemented and followed-up with monitoring and evaluation to see if they actually lead to improved care and patient safety. This continuum, which is based on a very close working relationship between researchers and clinicians is therefore very important.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Speaking to an audience of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, medical educators, students and other healthcare providers, Kaboli described a number of cases where quality improvement research had been used effectively. <br>\n <br>\n He said: &#x201C;Multidisciplinary care is a very good target for research-based quality improvement because it often draws together large and diverse teams that comprise doctors, nurses, other health professionals, social workers and others, each of whom have very different schedules and workloads. Using quality improvement research we have been able to test several different systems to see what works best for coordinating care.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The activity was an Accredited Group Learning Activity as defined by the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners-Accreditation Department and was approved for a maximum of 1.00 hours.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Amine Rakab, Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine and Assistant Dean for Clinical Learning at WCM-Q, said: &#x201C;We are delighted to welcome Dr. Kaboli to Qatar to share with us his very important insights into quality improvement and patient care. As we all know, these are continuous processes that never end, so we can all learn a great deal from him to help ensure our patients receive the best quality care in the safest possible environment.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://cdn.qf.com.qa/app/media/54840\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;\n mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:\n &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;color:blue\">click here</span></strong></a></p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf53","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-qs-grand-rounds-discuss-ways-to-improve-patient-care","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-qs-grand-rounds-discuss-ways-to-improve-patient-care","title":"WCM-Q's Grand Rounds Discuss Ways to Improve Patient Care"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
