Forbes responded by assigning her an assignment calculating the net worth of Stephen T. Winn, founder and CEO of RealPage, a firm that provides rental management software in the United States. After completing the assignment successfully, Seddiq was offered an internship with the publication. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image1-24.jpg\" alt=\"Image1.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Since starting her residency in January, Seddiq has worked on a number projects, including compiling billionaire profiles for Forbes&#x2019; 2018 richest people in the world, and stories related to that such as the planned closing of Toys R US and its potential impact on those who own toy companies. <br>\n <br>\n Seddiq said NU-Q classes covering enterprise reporting, data visualization, and statistics helped prepare her for the business journalism beat. So far, her Forbes training has taught her how to develop sources, speak to analysts and, most importantly, elicit information from those who might be hesitant to share.<br>\n <br>\n On the other side of the United States, Sara Al-Ansari is spending her residency with AJ+, Al Jazeera&#x2019;s digital platform in San Francisco. <br>\n <br>\n In addition to learning to enjoy pitching stories, she is also writing, researching, and editing her own short news videos on a wide range of subjects, including the longest running peaceful protest in U.S. history, the unexplained death of thousands of starfish in Britain, and the recent launch of Scientology&#x2019;s new TV network. <br>\n <br>\n Her AJ+ internship has also helped her confirm that she wants to pursue a journalism career. But her next stop is likely graduate school, with a focus on religion and media.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/JournalismEN.pdf\">here</a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf61","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-students-intern-at-forbes-aj-al-jazeera","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-students-intern-at-forbes-aj-al-jazeera","title":"NU-Q Students Intern at Forbes, AJ+, Al Jazeera"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
