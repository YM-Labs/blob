In addition to calling for collective action to enhance sustainability in Qatar, the selected logo depicts Qatar&#x2019;s vision for a sustainable and greener future. <br>\n <br>\n Commenting on the unveiling, Engineer Meshal Al Shamari, QGBC Director, said: &#x201C;Qatar is on its way to becoming a more sustainable country as both the government and the private sector have undertaken major steps towards ensuring a greener future. Qatar Sustainability Week will provide a unique opportunity for stakeholders to showcase their collective efforts and action for a better future.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I would like to express our sincere gratitude to Bachir for all the time and creativity he put into designing this incredibly unique logo, which will eventually become the symbol of this collective national drive for sustainability,&#x201D; Eng Al Shamari added. <br>\n The event coincides with the 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP 22) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) taking place in Morocco. <br>\n <br>\n QGBC is a member of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF). By launching Qatar Sustainability Week, QGBC supports QF&#x2019;s mission to foster a progressive society and promote sustainable development. <br>\n QGBC encourages all relevant stakeholders to take part by attending one or more of the planned events.
