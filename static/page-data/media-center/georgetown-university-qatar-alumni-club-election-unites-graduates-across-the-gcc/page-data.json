Founded in 1881, the Georgetown Alumni Association includes more than 160,000 alumni from all 50 states and more than 110 countries.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Currently, we have 400 club members, of which about 150 graduated here, from Georgetown&#x2019;s Qatar Foundation campus,&#x201D; Said Charles Nailen, Alumni Relations Manager at Georgetown University &#x2013; School of Foreign Service in Qatar (SFS-Qatar) and the main organizer of the alumni club&#x2019;s launch. <br>\n <br>\n James Faulkner, who graduated from the Washington DC campus of Georgetown&#x2019;s School of Foreign Service in 2000, and currently works for Booz Allen Hamilton in Qatar, ran for president of the alumni organization in the recent election, which resulted in a tie. He is now co-president, sharing the position with SFS-Qatar alum Basil Mahfouz. <br>\n <br>\n SFS-Qatar&#x2019;s alumni activities will continue breaking new ground in the region with the upcoming International Alumni Weekend event scheduled for 5-8 December, where Georgetown alumni and international club leaders from around the world will converge on Doha, the first time the separate groups meet at such an event, to share experiences and strengthen their alumni community. <br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on Georgetown&#x2019;s website, please <a href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/421204.html#.UpV4HCd6jto\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5qf7","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/georgetown-university-qatar-alumni-club-election-unites-graduates-across-the-gcc","currSlug":"/media-center/georgetown-university-qatar-alumni-club-election-unites-graduates-across-the-gcc","title":"Georgetown University Qatar Alumni Club Election Unites Graduates Across the GCC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
