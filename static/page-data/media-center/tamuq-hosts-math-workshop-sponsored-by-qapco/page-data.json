Berhanu at Temple University (USA); and Dr. Emil. Straube at Texas A&amp;M University (USA). The event was sponsored by Texas A&amp;M at Qatar, The College of Science and the Department of Mathematics at Texas A&amp;M University, and QAPCO.<br>\n <br>\n Straube, head of the Department of Mathematics at Texas A&amp;M&#x2019;s main campus and workshop co-organizer, said, &#x201C;A conference of this caliber adds substantial further visibility to the Science Program at Texas A&amp;M at Qatar and to Qatar as the Middle East research hub. The workshop was designed to spark mutually beneficial collaborations between mathematicians in the region and colleagues in Europe, Brazil, Japan and the U.S.&#x201D;<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf96","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/tamuq-hosts-math-workshop-sponsored-by-qapco","currSlug":"/media-center/tamuq-hosts-math-workshop-sponsored-by-qapco","title":"TAMUQ Hosts Math Workshop Sponsored by QAPCO"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
