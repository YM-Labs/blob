It will further demonstrate how behavioural insights can be applied at the macro level of high-level policies and system design, as well as at the micro level of experimentation, in order to achieve incremental improvements for the benefit of societies.<br>\n <br>\n David Halpern, Chief Executive of the Behavioural Insights Team and Board Director, and chair of the forum said, &#x201C;Behavioural factors - such as around diet, smoking, and accidents &#x2013; now account for the majority of healthy years of life lost. Within medical practice, behavioural factors also loom large in the transmission of infectious disease, medical adherence, and clinical errors. Yet these behavioural factors have received comparatively little attention, and the behavioural models within the medical community remain surprisingly undeveloped.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The report will also present a shortlist of the interventions that have the most potential, while stressing the importance of continually testing new ideas and adapting to the results they generate. <br>\n <img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/RESIZED%20QFT_WISH_Exhibition%20hall_21.jpg\" alt=\"null\"><br>\n Commenting on the announcement, WISH&#x2019;s CEO Egbert Schillings said: &#x201C;As with previous summits, WISH seeks to present pioneering and comprehensive scientific research that provides answers to some of the toughest questions facing the healthcare sector today. The Behavioural Insights Forum will no doubt be an important component in the body of research that will be presented at the 2016 conference.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/18%2001%2016%20Behavioural%20insights%20PR%20En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27qf89","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-announces-behavioural-insights-forum-and-report-for-2016-conference","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-announces-behavioural-insights-forum-and-report-for-2016-conference","title":"WISH Announces Behavioural Insights Forum and Report for 2016 Conference"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
