This project positions and gives value to the heritage of Arab modernities within an international context. <br>\n <img width=\"408\" height=\"255\" alt=\"Mathaf\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Mathaf%20Collection-9.jpg\"><br>\n This exhibition, titled <em>Summary, Part 1</em>, selects works produced from the twentieth century to give multiple entry points into the collection, through artistic research, historical moments, and aesthetic experimentations on the idea of an Arab modernity.<br>\n <br>\n By telling the story of the collection and documenting the art histories it contains, the exhibition interrogates new scholarly, educational, and experiential routes of access to contemporary tendencies.<br>\n <br>\n This exhibition presents over 100 artists from the collection, representing many parts of the Arab world and insisting on a multitude of artistic directions and contexts. <br>\n <br>\n The relationship between art and science is at play in the work of Abdel Hedi El Gazzar (Egypt, 1925-1966) whereas Ibrahim Al Salahi (Sudan, b. 1930) combines African and Arabic modernist visual trends, exemplifying artistic practices that were cross-referencing national cultures in progress. <br>\n <img width=\"300\" height=\"126\" alt=\"[ppm:alt id=5937]\" src=\"https://admin.qf.com.qa:443/app/media/21878\"><br>\n The work of self-trained artist Baya Mehielddine (Algeria, 1931-1998), who was engaged with her contemporary peers in Paris in the late 1940s, tells stories of women from Algeria. Manal Al Dowayan&#x2019;s (Saudia Arabia, b. 1973) research based artistic practice engages a progressive take on collective memory. <br>\n <br>\n The exhibition also presents the work of modernist pioneer Jasim Zainy (Qatar, 1933-2012) who was central in establishing an art scene in the Gulf region in the 1960s.<br>\n <br>\n Curated by Mathaf curators and researchers, Laura Barlow, Leonore-Namkha Beschi, Abdellah Karroum, and Yasser Mongy. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story on Mathaf&#x2019;s website, please <a href=\"http://www.mathaf.org.qa/en/exhibitions-list/227-mathaf-collection-summary,-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10qf2","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/mathaf-exhibition-summary-part-1","currSlug":"/media-center/mathaf-exhibition-summary-part-1","title":"Mathaf Exhibition: Summary, Part 1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
