It is run in English, in a part-time format and offers complete mobility between tracks. <br>\n <br>\n The Financial Times Executive MBA ranking is based on two sources: data about the program, the faculty, and the school in general, and feedback gathered from EMBA alumni who graduated three years earlier. The HEC Paris program is placed third in the career progress ranking. <br>\n <br>\n HEC Paris has been ranked one of the world&#x2019;s leading providers of Executive Education programs for the past eight years by the Financial Times, and The TRIUM Global Executive MBA joint program with NYU Stern School of Business and London School of Economics is ranked second. TRIUM has consistently been placed within the world&#x2019;s top five Executive MBA programs in the Financial Times rankings.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Nils Plambeck, Dean and CEO, HEC Paris in Qatar, said: &#x201C;This ranking is a recognition of the strength of our International Executive MBA program. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The program is supported by world-class faculty, offering an innovative curriculum and is backed by an outstanding alumni community. We are very grateful to our faculties, course leaders, majors directors, Capstone Project director, academic partners, and our staff for their strong dedication and contribution to the success of our programs. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;This ranking also reflects our commitment to deliver the best in-class management practices to current and future leaders and equip them with the skills to face the changing global market dynamics. As a member of Qatar Foundation, HEC Paris can bring world-class education to Qatar and thereby support Qatar National Vision 2030&#x201D;.<br>\n <br>\n The EMBA part-time program also has a strong global element, with its modules available in different locations. It offers a special focus on strategy, leadership and the global business environment to ensure that participants gain comprehensive, innovative, and applicable knowledge and skills that they can adapt to their specific roles and which will benefit their organizations.
