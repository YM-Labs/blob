Those already possessing an undergraduate law degree can also attend the program to help specialize their legal knowledge and broaden their skill sets. Classes for the first cohort of students will start in Fall 2015.<br>\n <br>\n The HBKU JD program is designed to serve individuals looking to enhance their legal knowledge, or who deal with legal issues in their professional careers. The analytical and critical thinking skills developed during this three-year intensive course make it equally appealing for those seeking to become Qatar&#x2019;s future thought leaders or policy makers. <br>\n <img width=\"639\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/379B6724-17.jpg\" alt=\"379B6724.jpg\"><br>\n The new JD program has been made possible through a strategic partnership with Northwestern University School of Law; with a strong focus on international comparative law, resulting from extensive consultation and effort with faculty and staff from Northwestern Law. <br>\n <br>\n HBKU will also work with partners from other leading international law schools in order to deliver a program that is uniquely targeted to meet the needs of Qatar and the region. <br>\n <br>\n For more information or to apply, please visit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/JD\"><strong>www.hbku.edu.qa/en/JD</strong></a><br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Law%20School%20Press%20Release%20EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6qf8","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hamad-bin-khalifa-university-launches-postgraduate-jd-program-law-degree-and-new-law-school","currSlug":"/media-center/hamad-bin-khalifa-university-launches-postgraduate-jd-program-law-degree-and-new-law-school","title":"Hamad bin Khalifa University Launches Postgraduate JD Program Law Degree and New Law School"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
