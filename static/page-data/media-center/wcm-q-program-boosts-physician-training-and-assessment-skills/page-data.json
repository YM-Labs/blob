This allows the trainee to develop a diverse &#x2018;toolbox&#x2019; of skills so they can operate effectively in a variety of situations and with different patients, and our facilities at WCM-Q allow trainers to give very precise feedback. We are very pleased that the participants have shown so much commitment and enthusiasm to learn how to design and implement an effective OSCE program.&#x201D;<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo2-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"624\"><br>\n The final learning session made use of the Clinical Skills Center&#x2019;s hi-tech examination rooms, which are equipped with audiovisual monitoring systems that allow faculty to discreetly assess learners as they perform simulated consultations with standardized patients. <br>\n <br>\n This was the second year the course has been offered, and it will continue to run on an annual basis. Two physicians who completed the course last year as participants&#x2014;Dr. Liam Fernyhough, Assistant Professor of Medicine at WCM-Q, and Dr. Hassan Mobayad, Allergy and Pulmonary Consultant at Hamad Medical Corporation&#x2014;served as instructors this year. WCM-Q&#x2019;s Dr. Stella Major, Associate Professor of Family Medicine in Clinical Medicine, and Lan Sawan, Manager of the Clinical Skills Center, also facilitated the delivery of the program. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170320%20English%20English%20WCM-Q%20program%20boosts%20physician%20training%20and%20assessment%20skills.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf17","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-program-boosts-physician-training-and-assessment-skills","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-program-boosts-physician-training-and-assessment-skills","title":"WCM-Q Program Boosts Physician Training and Assessment Skills"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
