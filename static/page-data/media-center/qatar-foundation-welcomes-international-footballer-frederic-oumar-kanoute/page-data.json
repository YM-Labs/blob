A welcoming committee received Kanout&#xE9;, who currently plays for the Chinese Super League team Beijing Guoan FC, at the Qatar Foundation Visitors Center. <br>\n <br>\n During a glittering career the French-born Malian footballer has played for several of Europe&#x2019;s top teams including Tottenham Hotspur FC, Lyon FC, and Sevilla FC, as well as Mali&#x2019;s national team. A devout Muslim and devotee of many humanitarian causes, he established the Kanout&#xE9; Foundation in 2006 to promote causes close to his heart. In 2010 the charity opened its flagship project, the Sakina Children&apos;s Village in Mali, which currently houses over 60 orphans and provides them with access to education, health and sports facilities. Kanout&#xE9; recently arrived in Qatar to accept the position of Goodwill Ambassador for Qatar Charity.<br>\n <br>\n He was introduced to Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s many educational initiatives, community development plans and scientific research programmes through a presentation which outlined the vision and mission of Qatar Foundation. He was then briefed on Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s various sustainability initiatives and climate action solutions. After the presentation, he was shown an impressive 3D scale model of the current buildings and construction projects underway at Qatar Foundation.<br>\n <br>\n Commenting on the occasion, Kanout&#xE9; said, &#x201C;I was extremely impressed with Qatar Foundation&#x2019;s vision to move from a carbon economy to a knowledge economy by investing in education, research and community development. The visit has been inspirational, as it is similar to the work we do at the Kanout&#xE9; Foundation, where we focus on education and development in Mali. Our beliefs at Kanout&#xE9; Foundation echo that of Qatar Foundation. We believe that the best way to ensure a sustainable future is to invest in education and in our people.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n He added, &#x201C;Qatar Foundation is playing a very important role in the development of Qatar and the region by supplying a high level of education which in turn provides youth with an incredible amount of opportunities in Qatarand globally.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n As the visit drew to a close, Kanout&#xE9; signed the visitor&#x2019;s book and presented Qatar Foundation representatives with a signed football shirt. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf28","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-welcomes-international-footballer-frederic-oumar-kanoute","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-welcomes-international-footballer-frederic-oumar-kanoute","title":"Qatar Foundation Welcomes International Footballer Frédéric Oumar Kanouté"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
