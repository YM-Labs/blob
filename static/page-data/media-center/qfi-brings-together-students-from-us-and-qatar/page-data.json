During this 12-week program, students from the U.S. and Qatar participated in a series of six service learning and leadership training webinars, and developed their own service-learning projects with the support of a professional mentor via a virtual platform. The program culminated with a virtual showcase in which students presented their projects to a panel of judges, competing for the opportunity to be part of a one-week trip to Qatar to attend the 2018 EMPOWER Conference.<br>\n <br>\n Zana Murrie, a student at Chattahoochee High School in Atlanta, Georgia, who attended EMPOWER 2018, said: &#x201C;Attending this trip to Qatar gave me an opportunity to spread awareness beyond my community and move a step closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals within my community.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n This year&#x2019;s EMPOWER conference included panel discussions, workshops, seminars, and activities over a three-day period. <br>\n Students from QFI&#x2019;s YALLAH Commit to Action program presented their projects during multiple sessions, which included Emotional Education Project, Food for All, Hydration Nation, and No E-Waste.<br>\n &#x201C;We are so proud of these C2A students &#x2013; they inspire us with their commitment to positively impact their communities and then bridge tremendous distances to find ways of working together,&#x201D; said Maggie Mitchell Salem, Executive Director of QFI. &#x201C;To us, the SDGs become real for students when they can be part of practical, hands-on projects that deliver real benefit to those around them &#x2013; and those thousands of miles away.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n In addition to attending and presenting at EMPOWER, the students spent a week together in Qatar learning about the Arabic language and Arab heritage while visiting Qatar&#x2019;s cultural landmarks.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_QFI_Empower_PressRelease_EN_20180318.pdf\">here</a>. <br>\n &#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf38","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qfi-brings-together-students-from-us-and-qatar","currSlug":"/media-center/qfi-brings-together-students-from-us-and-qatar","title":"QFI Brings Together Students from U.S. and Qatar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
