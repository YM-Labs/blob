QGBC and Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar (TAMU-Q), with funding from Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), have initiated the first scientific study to determine whether the behavior of the personnel who maintain and operate these buildings &#xA0;&#x2013; facilities management &#x2013; is at the heart of this disconnect.</p>\n <p>&#x201C;The way that building performance is evaluated must change,&#x201D; said the Director of the Center for Health Systems &amp; Design at Texas A&amp;M University, Dr Mardelle Shepley, a member of the research team, explaining that, traditionally, green building performance is evaluated on its economic benefits and energy consumption, discounting human factors.</p>\n <p>In post-occupancy evaluation, buildings are also appraised from the perspective of their end-users, such as students at a school or doctors in a hospital. Dr Shepley asserts that the QGBC/TAMU-Q study is the first to address the role of facilities management on the operations of sustainable buildings.</p>\n <p>&#x201C;Understanding the experience of facility management staff is critical to the effectiveness of sustainable buildings,&#x201D; said Dr Shepley, underlining the pivotal role that maintenance personnel play in evaluating building performance, given their unique position in understanding the building owners, its end-users, and the structure itself.</p>\n <p>&#x201C;Our study will evaluate and compare three archetype buildings in Qatar that represent the commercial, institutional and residential; RasGas Headquarters, Education City Clubhouse and Qatar&#x2019;s first Passivhaus, Baytna,&#x201D; explained Dr John Bryant, associated professor of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar. The team believes the difference in facilities management and operations between these types of buildings will be reflected in their performance.</p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf56","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qgbc-examines-green-building-facilities-management","currSlug":"/media-center/qgbc-examines-green-building-facilities-management","title":"QGBC Examines Green Building Facilities Management"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
