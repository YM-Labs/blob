We should strive for long-lasting change through such campaigns led by Qatar Green Building Council which can be stimulus for real change in Qatar.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Participants praised the impact of QGBC&#x2019;s No Paper Day initiative in April that witnessed 20 major national and multinational companies coming together to promote recycling and sustainable paper use.Building on the achievements of last year, participating firms reduced their paper consumption by an astonishing 73 percent on the day.<br>\n <br>\n The &#x2018;No Paper Day&#x2019; initiative is another in a line of campaigns from beach clearances to bottle top art projects led by QGBC that are designed to educate the public on environmental sustainability and waste reduction.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/14-05-2014%20QGBC%20Waste%20Management%20%20PR%20-%20ENGLISH.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18qf73","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qgbcs-effective-waste-management-strategies-lead-the-nation-towards-a-stronger-future","currSlug":"/media-center/qgbcs-effective-waste-management-strategies-lead-the-nation-towards-a-stronger-future","title":"QGBC’s Effective Waste Management Strategies Lead the Nation Towards a Stronger Future"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
