Dennis, dean and CEO. &#x201C;As Qatar continues to make progress in developing the infrastructure of its educational system, our students&#x2019; work showcases the significant changes and developments that have happened in that sector over the last few decades.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The website is the final project created by NU-Q journalism and strategic communication students who are enrolled in the Advanced Online Storytelling course. The five-week intensive course is designed to teach students to gather data and develop written and visual content that addresses a particular theme about Qatar. Students experience working under a deadline and get to explore different areas of multi-media storytelling, such as print, video, graphics, and public relations. <br>\n <br>\n In previous years, NU-Q students enrolled in the course produced a website on Qatar&#x2019;s architectural landscape and urban development, which explored Qatari heritage through modern architecture; and a website on road safety that was designed to raise awareness about traffic reforms and the consequences of reckless driving on accident victims.<br>\n &#x201C;As Qatar continues to progress and develop into a knowledge economy, an understanding of its current education system and reform policies is crucial,&#x201D; said NU-Q Professor Christina Paschyn, who teaches the course. &#x201C;This student-produced website examines the current state of education in Qatar, its successes, and what challenges the country still faces.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n On the website, users can view timelines on the development of education in Qatar since the 1920&#x2019;s. They can also view short documentaries about reform programs and read articles about ongoing challenges in that sector. <br>\n <br>\n The students were divided into four groups &#x2013; one was the website operations team that built and designed the webpage; another &#x2013; the multimedia team &#x2013; worked on video stories; the print team wrote articles; the infographics team created visual elements, and the public relations team designed a communications strategy to promote the website.<br>\n <br>\n To view the website, click here: <a href=\"https://sites.northwestern.edu/qtaaleam/\">https://sites.northwestern.edu/qtaaleam/<br>\n </a><br>\n To read more, click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Qtaaleam%20_FINAL.pdf\">here</a>.<br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf64","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-students-launch-education-system-website","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-students-launch-education-system-website","title":"NU-Q Students Launch Education System Website"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
