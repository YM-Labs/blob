The event was part of WCM-Q&#x2019;s Sahtak Awalan: Your Health First campaign, a five-year initiative that aims to encourage members of both the expat and Qatari communities to make healthy lifestyle choices. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Khan stressed that breastfeeding should not be viewed as a supplement to a baby&#x2019;s diet, but as the basis of proper infant nutrition. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo3.jpg\" alt=\"Photo3.jpg\" height=\"1800\" width=\"1309\"><br>\n Breast milk contains a wide variety of nutrients essential to the healthy development of babies, including vital proteins, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates and fats. The milk also contains anti-infective components, many important hormones and special enzymes that aid digestion and absorption of nutrients. <br>\n <br>\n The initiative runs a twice-weekly post-natal and daily walk-in clinic to support working mothers, first-time mothers and urgent cases, and a scheduled Lactation Management Clinic once a week at Al-Wakra Hospital. New mothers are helped with breastfeeding advice and practical care before birth, in the crucial first moments after birth and then for as long as they need support. &#xA0;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160320%20English%20WCM-Q%20event%20offers%20expert%20advice%20on%20breastfeeding.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a></div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf78","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-event-offers-expert-advice-on-breastfeeding","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-event-offers-expert-advice-on-breastfeeding","title":"WCM-Q Event Offers Expert Advice on Breastfeeding"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
