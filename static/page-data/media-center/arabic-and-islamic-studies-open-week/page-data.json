While open house days are common practice in schools, the Arabic Open Week is a valuable &#x201C;opportunity for parents to experience the teaching methods used in the Arabic, Islamic Studies and Qatar History subjects and to strengthen their relationship with the teacher, &#x201C; Nour Al Hajri the department&#x2019;s Academic Coordinator explains.<br>\n <br>\n An introductory parent information meeting opened the week which served as a primer about the three subjects. &#x201C;The purpose is to introduce them to the resources, curriculum, policies and assessment tools used by the subjects in order to promote QA&#x2019;s vision and mission,&#x201D; she says. By checking their children&#x2019;s schedules online through the class blogs, parents are able to sign up for the schedule most suitable to them.
