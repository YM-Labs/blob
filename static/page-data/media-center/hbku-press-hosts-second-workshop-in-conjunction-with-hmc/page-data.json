HBKU Press aims to support and retain local researchers while providing them with the resources and the platform to have their work published by a world-class publishing house founded on international best practices, excellence and innovation.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Community outreach is an integral part of what we do at HBKU Press,&#x201D; explains Saffiyah Al-Nuaimi, Managing Editor of Qatar Medical Journal. &#x201C;One of the overall goals of this publishing house is to have a platform where local researchers from the region have the opportunity to contribute to the local and global academic research landscape. That&#x2019;s why our academic publishing platform, QScience.com, was developed under an open access model which allows for authors to share their work freely, with higher access, download and sharing rates, while ensuring proper citation. The entire publishing process with HBKU Press is in line with international standards meant to keep the author and the author&#x2019;s interests at the heart of the publishing process.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The workshop gave participants insight on the proper way to submit research articles to QMJ, how authors can promote their research and work, and the benefits of publishing with HBKU Press.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/03%2019%202017_HBKU%20Press%20holds%20workshop%20in%20conjunction%20with%20HMC_EN.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7qf4","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hbku-press-hosts-second-workshop-in-conjunction-with-hmc","currSlug":"/media-center/hbku-press-hosts-second-workshop-in-conjunction-with-hmc","title":"HBKU Press Hosts Second Workshop in Conjunction With HMC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
