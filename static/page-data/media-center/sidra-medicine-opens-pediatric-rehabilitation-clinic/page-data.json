Sidra Medicine is also proud to announce that Dr. Lisa Thornton - the former University of Chicago, Director for Pediatric Rehabilitation &#x2013; has been appointed as the Division Chief of Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Dr%20Lisa-24.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n The clinic helps manage the health of children with physical disabilities such as paralysis, cerebral palsy and brain damage. Patients are currently referred internally from Sidra Medicine&#x2019;s own in-house teams, as well as Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) and Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC). The service will be expanded to accept referrals from doctors who practice outside of these institutions in 2018. The clinic expects to see more than 1,000 patients in its first year. <br>\n <br>\n The clinic&#x2019;s focus will be on a multidisciplinary, community-based approach - working with young patients and their families under the leadership of Dr. Thornton, who has over 20 years of experience in the field. The IDPD&#x2019;s theme this year &#x201C;transformation towards sustainable and resilient society for all&#x201D;, also aligns with Dr. Thornton&#x2019;s philosophy of strengthening the support network around a child and helping parents throughout the journey by empowering them with knowledge and guidance. <br>\n <br>\n The Rehabilitation Clinic ensures the patient is seen by Dr. Thornton together with a physical therapist and an occupational therapist. Combining the collective expertise of a child&#x2019;s rehabilation team allows for the development of a more tailored, holistic approach for every child. As part of this wide-ranging spectrum of care and support, the family will also receive a personalized plan on what to expect regarding the impact their child&#x2019;s disability will have on their lives, and receive guidance on the best ways to help their child reach their full potential. <br>\n <br>\n Speaking about the clinic&#x2019;s broader, long-term vision for creating a community-based ecosystem, Dr. Thornton emphasized that a child with a disability is just as healthy and capable as those without physical disabilities and should be encouraged to pursue any interest, be it sports, music or travel. <br>\n <br>\n Dr. Thornton holds three board certifications in Pediatrics, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, a mark of skill and dedication achieved by fewer than 300 practitioners in the U.S. where Dr. Thornton practiced before moving to Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Sidra%20Medicine%20Opens%20Rehab%20Clinic%2030%20Nov%202017%20ENG%20FINAL.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21qf60","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/sidra-medicine-opens-pediatric-rehabilitation-clinic","currSlug":"/media-center/sidra-medicine-opens-pediatric-rehabilitation-clinic","title":"Sidra Medicine Opens Pediatric Rehabilitation Clinic"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
