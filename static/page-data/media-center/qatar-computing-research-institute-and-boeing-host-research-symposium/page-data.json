Machine learning is an expanding research domain where algorithms are developed to learn from data, thus helping to process massive amounts of data through applying predictive techniques.<br>\n <br>\n Boeing and QCRI signed an agreement in early 2013 to jointly investigate ways to better recognise patterns, correlations and anomalies in massive amounts of data through machine learning algorithms and data analytics techniques applicable to aircraft maintenance data.This agreement will result in the development of statistical and analytical methods for learning predictors and detectors in airplane health management.<br>\n <br>\n Researchers and students were invited to submit research abstracts related to the domain, and if accepted, asked to present their research at the symposium.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/26-01-2014_PR%20QCRI%20and%20Boeing%20MLDAS_%20English%20_Final.pdf\">click here.</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf2","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-computing-research-institute-and-boeing-host-research-symposium","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-computing-research-institute-and-boeing-host-research-symposium","title":"Qatar Computing Research Institute And Boeing Host Research Symposium"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
