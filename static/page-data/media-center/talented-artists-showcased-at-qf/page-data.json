Art has the power to captivate people, so it&#x2019;s a great way to explore our country&#x2019;s rich culture and history, while also inspiring people to engage in artistic pursuits.&#x201D;<br>\n <img width=\"2000\" height=\"1727\" alt=\"Image 1.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%201.jpg\"><br>\n Each artist prepared a minimum of two canvasses for the exhibition. The artworks were created as part of a week-long workshop held at QF&#x2019;s Recreation Center, held prior to the launch of the exhibition. The space was used by the participants to interact, network and share knowledge, through the discussion of technique, colour and subject.<br>\n <img width=\"2000\" height=\"1534\" alt=\"Image 3.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%203.jpg\"><br>\n Lulwa Al Mogeseeb, one of three Qataris participating in the event, explained: &#x201C;In my work I explore the diversity of my country, and I explore the past, present and future of Qatar in my paintings through both subject and colour.
