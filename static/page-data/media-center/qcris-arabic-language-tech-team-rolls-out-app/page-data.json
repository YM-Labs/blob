The students were required to make the application intuitive, interactive and intelligent, by gauging and adapting the exercise modules according to the user to maximize learning.</p>\n <p>To achieve this they analyzed existing CALL and e-learning apps to identify weaknesses and strengths, read papers on optical character recognition and speech recognition, and designed and implemented various training modules to support learners of elementary Arabic in practicing their language skills through listening, reading, speaking, and writing.</p>\n <p>The result was a product they named &#x2018;<em>Arabia</em>.&#x2019;</p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf88","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qcris-arabic-language-tech-team-rolls-out-app","currSlug":"/media-center/qcris-arabic-language-tech-team-rolls-out-app","title":"QCRI’s Arabic Language Tech Team Rolls Out App"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
