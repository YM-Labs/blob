Educational posters and leaflets were distributed to educate participants about the advantages of giving blood.<br>\n <br>\n Ms Al-Saadi said, &#x201C;We have received dozens of applications from various departments at Qatar Foundation, and from a large number of students who are aged 18 and older. I am especially pleased to see such a significant level of interest and involvement among the student body, since we are eager to engage young people by fostering awareness about the significance of donating blood and taking part in events that serve the greater community.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n During the campaign, 45 units of blood were collected from 106 participants who met the necessary criteria and were considered eligible donors. Before any blood could be collected, the health history of every potential donor was carefully assessed by staff from HMC&#x2019;s Blood Donation Unit, in order to ensure the highest standards of safety. Volunteers also received a brief examination, during which certified nurses measured their temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and hemoglobin levels.<br>\n <br>\n This event is in keeping with the numerous community initiatives and activities organized by Qatar Foundation to educate the public about essential health issues, so as to create a healthier and more productive environment. It follows on from the HSSE Directorate&#x2019;s recent &#x2018;Pink Ribbon Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign,&#x2019; which highlighted the positive impact of early breast cancer detection and diagnosis.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13qf49","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-encourages-community-to-donate-blood","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-encourages-community-to-donate-blood","title":"Qatar Foundation Encourages Community To Donate Blood"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
