The courses, which are offered annually, focus on a wide range of self-improvement topics, such as healthy living, public speaking, and self-awareness. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/HBKU%20Community%20Classes%20will%20be%20held%20at%20the%20Student%20Center%20in%20Education%20City-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" width=\"640\" height=\"425\"><br>\n One of the courses targets those who are looking to pursue a healthier lifestyle. During the course, participants will construct their own customized nutrition and fitness plans under the guidance of Dana Habayeb, a certified personal trainer and nutritional consultant. The class will also focus on weight loss techniques and how to make healthier choices based on proven scientific research. <br>\n <br>\n Another course is directed towards women who are seeking to gain deeper insights into their personality. The workshop will help participants understand the link between their bodies, minds, and spirits and how they can leverage these elements to lead a balanced and fulfilling life.<br>\n <br>\n The courses also aim to build a community of well-rounded leaders. Career professionals who are interested in honing their self-confidence and public speaking can register for the &#x201C;Effective Presentation and Public Speaking Skills&#x201D; course. Training in this course will revolve around effective and professional presentation skills in the modern workplace. It will use advanced techniques for capturing the attention of audiences and for engaging them by using appropriate voices, tones, and body language, depending on the situation.<br>\n <br>\n Commenting on the aim of HBKU&#x2019;s community classes, Maryam Al Mannai, vice president of student affairs at HBKU, said: &#x201C;Initiatives such as HBKU&#x2019;s community classes help build bridges between the public and the University, and create an environment that values learning and sharing. At HBKU, we recruit the best available instructors who are qualified in delivering an outstanding classroom learning experience. Offered annually, these classes are in line with our community development initiatives and HBKU&#x2019;s contribution towards achieving Qatar&#x2019;s National Vision for 2030.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;I participated in two HBKU Community Classes earlier this year, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself,&#x201D; said Moza Al Thani, who took the Food Safety and How to Train Yourself courses at the University. &#x201C;I still remember all the details from the classes - they greatly influenced the way I think about the food I consume, and motivated me to make lifestyle changes that greatly impacted my daily routine,&#x201D; she said.<br>\n <br>\n All courses begin in the first week of October, and the deadline for registration is September 17.
