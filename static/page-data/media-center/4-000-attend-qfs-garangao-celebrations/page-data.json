It first began as a daytime festival within tribal communities as both a reward and a distraction for children during fasting hours. In more recent years, however, it has evolved into a night-time event, where children are provided with sweets, gifts and the chance to participate in team games and other much-loved pastimes.<br>\n <img width=\"2000\" height=\"3338\" alt=\"Image 11.jpg\" src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image%2011.jpg\"><br>\n A packed Al Shaqab Centre played host to a superbly entertaining and culturally-engaging Garangao night of celebrations.
