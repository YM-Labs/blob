The Doha-based open access publisher has integrated the latest social reading software from ReadSocial, the US-based start-up founded by Travis Alber and Aaron Miller. The <em>QScience</em> and ReadSocial partnership makes it possible for readers of <em>QScience</em> journals to add commentary to any paragraph of any research article on the site, and not just at the end of the piece where the context of a comment is often lost.</p>\n <p>This means that when other researchers come to the article they&#x2019;ll see comments made by others adjacent to the relevant paragraph, and they can respond with a comment, link or image. <em>QScience</em> is the first academic publisher to deploy this technology.</p>\n <p>ReadSocial is a mobile-and-web solution for publishers and developers who want to integrate universal annotations and reading groups with their content.</p></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19qf57","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qscience-easier-to-comment-and-share-research","currSlug":"/media-center/qscience-easier-to-comment-and-share-research","title":"QScience: Easier to Comment And Share Research"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
