Dennis, Dean and CEO, NU-Q. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;While faculty are expected to do research and present it to their peers, is it highly unusual for undergraduate students to have their work accepted at major conferences, and some of our colleagues in the field mistake them for advanced graduate students.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n Two NU-Q researchers received special recognition at AEJMC. Professor George Anghelcev won second place for a paper he co-authored on the psychological effects of information-searching and paid advertisements; and NU-Q&#x2019;s Research Manager Elizabeth Lance received a grant from the Commission on the Status of Women supporting her dissertation on the depiction and representation of women in Qatari media. <br>\n <br>\n At this conference, Dennis led a high-level panel on the rise of fake news on the internet, specifically the role of social media in driving the blockade of Qatar, which referenced key findings from NU-Q&#x2019;s five-year report on media use in the Middle East. <br>\n <br>\n Meanwhile, Mary Dedinsky, Director of the Journalism and Strategic Communication Program, NU-Q led a panel at IPIWC in Nigeria, addressing journalists&#x2019; battle against misinformation and the implications of fake news and propaganda on creating a false understanding of the truth and delegitimizing news media. <br>\n <br>\n Three NU-Q faculty members - Professor Andrew Mills, Professor Amy Kristin Sanders, and Professor Joe F. Khalil - presented on media reforms in education and entertainment at the IAMCR conference in Eugene, Oregon; while, at the ICA annual meeting in Prague, Professors Banu Akdenizli and Professor Craig LaMay presented their research on digital diplomacy throughout the GCC crisis and the cultural politics of the Arab female identity in the region. <br>\n &#xA0;<br>\n To read more, please click&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Summer%20Research_Final_ENG.pdf\">here</a><br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf50","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-research-showcased-across-the-world","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-research-showcased-across-the-world","title":"NU-Q Research Showcased Across The World"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
