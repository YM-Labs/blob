The recruitment of new medical faculty who are based at affiliate institutions broadens the range of opportunities for students to learn from qualified physicians, as well as helping to equip Qatar with a new generation of doctors in line with the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030 and the National Health Strategy. <br>\n <br>\n The welcome addresses were followed by two panel discussions that explored the role of affiliated faculty in contributing to the medical students&#x2019; education and to the achievement of the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030. The event, which was coordinated by WCMC-Q&#x2019;s Office of Faculty Affairs, concluded with a tour of the college facilities for the new faculty members and a networking lunch session. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/141118%20English%20WCMC-Q%20welcomes%20new%20faculty%20to%20the%20fold.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf95","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcmc-q-welcomes-new-faculty-to-the-fold","currSlug":"/media-center/wcmc-q-welcomes-new-faculty-to-the-fold","title":"WCMC-Q Welcomes New Faculty To The Fold"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
