The project will study how fresh produce is handled and sold and how different factors could increase the dangers of microbial hazards.<br>\n <br>\n Another study will develop a design for a remote-controlled robot or a smart vehicle equipped with photo processing and video precision guidance systems that utilize sound waves to test and clean water tankers and fuel storage facilities.<br>\n <br>\n A third funded proposal will develop a design for a device that will send and receive data simultaneously and on the same frequency, whereby providing solutions for problems linked with interference. This study could lead to many positive results, which includes doubling the effectiveness and simplifying the frequency planning in wireless networks. <br>\n <br>\n In another study, researchers presented their vision of developing a portable medical system in Qatar that monitors the health status of patients and works on minimal energy consumption. Expanding upon the concept of social networks, the researchers will develop a communications and information sharing protocol that will allow for effective communication between patients by storing and sharing their data. <br>\n <br>\n The study will also look into effective methods for energy conservation while transmitting data on programmed wireless networks, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol and its practical applications.<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/26-08-2014%20QNRF%20GSRA%202nd%20Cycle%20Results%20Press%20Release-ENGLISH.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"aqf84","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/applications-soar-61-percent-for-qatar-national-research-fund-graduate-student-research-awards","currSlug":"/media-center/applications-soar-61-percent-for-qatar-national-research-fund-graduate-student-research-awards","title":"Applications Soar 61 Percent for Qatar National Research Fund Graduate Student Research Awards"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
