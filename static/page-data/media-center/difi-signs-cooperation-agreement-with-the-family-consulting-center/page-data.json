According to this agreement, DIFI will conduct an empirical study to assess the preparation program set for people intending to get married, males and females, provided by FCC. The study aims at evaluating and developing this program and upgrading its outcomes. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/DIFI%20Logo-17.jpg\" alt=\"DIFI Logo.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"386\"><br>\n Through this cooperation, the two parties aim to achieve their common objectives of promoting Qatari families. In addition, this agreement falls within the scope of DIFI&#x2019;s action to support family policies in the State of Qatar by strengthening the knowledge base on Qatari families, evaluating policies and developing programs on families and their members. The preparation program benefiting Qataris intending to marry is considered one of the most important programs aiming at providing them with the basics and know-how required to establish a well-functioning, successful and stable family through the adoption of a preventive approach that contributes to reducing marital conflicts and high divorce rate. The study, which will be conducted by DIFI, to assess the impact of FCC&#x2019;s program on its beneficiaries and the prospects of its development, is the first of its kind to be carried out in this program since its inception in 2003 and is part of the development efforts exerted by FCC.<br>\n <br>\n Ms. Noor Al Malki Al Jehani, DIFI&#x2019;s Executive Director, in her comment on this cooperation agreement said: &quot;We are delighted to partner with the Family Consulting Center, and look forward to supporting the programs it offers for the benefit of the family. The study we are going to carry out, to investigate the impact of the preparation program on its beneficiaries and how to develop it, comes in line with our continued efforts to support the formulation of evidence-based policies and programs, drawing on the best practices. We are fully aware of the importance of this program; therefore, DIFI will implement this study and fund the related research activities.&quot; <br>\n <br>\n In his comment on the Agreement, Mr. Rashid Al Dosari, Director of the Family Counseling Center (FCC), said that the &#x201C;cooperation agreement between the Center and DIFI is an important step in supporting the community outreach services provided by the Center, especially the preparation program offered to people intending to get married. This program marked our first awareness endeavor that introduced the Family Counseling Center to the community for the first time back in 2003.&quot;<br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/DIFI-FCC%20Press%20Release%20-%20EN%20Final.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf71","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/difi-signs-cooperation-agreement-with-the-family-consulting-center","currSlug":"/media-center/difi-signs-cooperation-agreement-with-the-family-consulting-center","title":"DIFI Signs Cooperation Agreement with the Family Consulting Center"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
