In line with QF&#x2019;s mission, the competition is designed to promote sustainable development and inspire environmental responsibility among young people. <br>\n <br>\n The contest is being held in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education and Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), also a member of QF, within the framework of QNRF&#x2019;s National Scientific Research Competition for school students in Qatar.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image2%20(17)-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image2 (17).jpg\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\"><br>\n The research competition seeks to provide innovative and practical solutions for contemporary environmental problems, with particular emphasis on plants, water, and agriculture in light of the current political circumstances in the region. The contest aims to give the opportunity for students to study the causes of the problems and provide practical solutions that can be implemented on the ground.<br>\n <br>\n Mrs. Fatima Saleh Al Khulaifi, Manager, QBG, said: &#x201C;The role of the Qur&#x2019;anic Botanic Garden in this competition is to oversee the students&#x2019; research, and provide scientific advice and technical support to participating schools. The Qur&#x2019;anic Botanic Garden is also working alongside various universities, institutions, and scientific entities in Qatar, such as Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar University, and the Ministry of Municipality and Environment. QBG has already hosted a number of educational workshops for participating students and teachers at the Education City Student Center, and has organized a series of site visits to the QF plant nursery.&#x201D;<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image3%20(9)-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image3 (9).jpg\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\"><br>\n QBG is helping to review and design prospective research proposals. So far, 30 abstracts have been submitted, focusing on important issues such as agriculture, re-purposing leftover food and drink, aquaponics, and the economical re-use of farm residues and landscape areas. Proposals also discuss the study and evaluation of wild plants, desertification, the consumption of natural resources such as water, and microorganisms that infect fruit and vegetable crops in Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n In order to honor the winners of the contest, QBG will organize a ceremony in February during the celebration of Qatar National Environment Day 2018. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf39","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qbg-organizes-environmental-research-contest","currSlug":"/media-center/qbg-organizes-environmental-research-contest","title":"QBG Organizes Environmental Research Contest"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
