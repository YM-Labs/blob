Additionally, the program allows the students to develop a sense of civic engagement and a global perspective.&#x201D;<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo2%20(7)-24.jpg\" alt=\"Photo2 (7).jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n In the Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Hospital, the students observed basic healthcare duties like taking blood pressure measurements, mixing medicines, and removing acupuncture needles, under the supervision of trained professionals. They also observed physicians cleaning and dressing wounds, repairing fractured bones and damaged nerves, and using massage and other physiotherapy techniques to relieve pain and increase range of motion in patients&#x2019; joints. In the daycare center, they worked closely with children with cerebral palsy, Down&#x2019;s syndrome and ADHD, helping out at mealtimes and keeping the children entertained with games and songs. <br>\n <br>\n In addition, the students learned about some of the healthcare challenges facing Vietnam, a lower-middle income country, which includes a high incidence of motorcycle accidents, stroke and cardiovascular diseases. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo3%20(6)-24.jpg\" alt=\"Photo3 (6).jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n Student Hiba Naveed found the experience inspiring, saying: &#x201C;The system itself, despite so much noise and clustering, did not seem haphazard at all. It seemed as though the informality of the hospital was an aid in its own way. <br>\n &#x201C;There was never a dull moment and this seemed integral to the healing process of the patients.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read more,please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180715%20English%20WCM-Q%20students%20explore%20global%20health%20issues%20in%20Vietnam.pdf\">here</a>.</strong><br>\n <br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf40","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-students-visit-vietnam","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-students-visit-vietnam","title":"WCM-Q Students Visit Vietnam"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
