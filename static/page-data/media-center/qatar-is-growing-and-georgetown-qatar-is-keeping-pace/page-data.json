For Georgetown, brick and mortar expansion has given way to a program expansion, with the announcement of a significant number of newly appointed faculty members, the launch of a new major and the introduction of a brand new certificate in media and politics offered in partnership with Northwestern University in Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n This coming academic year will see a total of 248 students enrolled in GU-Q&#x2019;s four-year undergraduate program, representing 46 different countries, with roughly one third of the student body comprised of Qatari citizens. GU-Q offers Bachelor of Science degrees in International Politics, International Economics and Culture &amp; Politics, and International History.<br>\n <br>\n The 15 new academics slated to join GU-Q&#x2019;s Qatar Foundation campus in this expansion drive include faculty members from across several disciplines, including economics, applied linguistics, English, world literature, and Arabic language, literature and culture.<br>\n <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/408188.html#\"><br>\n To read the full article on Georgetown&#x2019;s website, please click here.<br>\n </a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf85","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-is-growing-and-georgetown-qatar-is-keeping-pace","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-is-growing-and-georgetown-qatar-is-keeping-pace","title":"Qatar Is Growing, And Georgetown Qatar Is Keeping Pace"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
