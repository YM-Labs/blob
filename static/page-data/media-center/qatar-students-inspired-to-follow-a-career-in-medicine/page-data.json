The four each received a fully-funded, one-week Doctors of the Future Scholarship to study in the world-class biomedical research laboratories at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. They also attended lectures and learned what life is like for a medical student at one of the world&#x2019;s top medical colleges. <br>\n <br>\n In addition, the four spent a week at Cornell University in Ithaca in upstate New York which gave them a more varied view of student life. This section of the trip was designed by Dr. Krystyna Golkowska, WCM-Q&#x2019;s associate professor of English, and was designed to give the students an idea of what it is like to study for an undergraduate degree and to acquaint them with Cornell as an institution. Each winner was accompanied by a member of their families as a chaperone.<br>\n <br>\n Dr. Rachid Bendriss, Assistant Dean for Student Recruitment, Outreach and Foundation Programs at WCM-Q, explained the importance of the initiative.<br>\n <br>\n He said: &#x201C;Designed and implemented by the Office of Student Recruitment and Outreach, the program, which is now in its 10th year, continues to inspire the future generation of Qatari physicians to pursue a career in medicine. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Considered one of the highest yield outreach programs the college is running, more than 90 percent of the participants end up as doctors-in-training at WCM-Q.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n This year&#x2019;s scholarship winners &#x2013; twins Alia Salman Ashkanani and Ghalya Salman Ashkanani, both of Michael E.
