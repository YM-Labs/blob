It was conducted by HEC Paris Affiliate Professor Dr. Wolfgang Amann, who has designed and delivered executive education seminars for more than 20 years, and currently serves as professor of Strategy and leadership, as well as Academic Director of several programs at HEC Paris in Qatar.<br>\n <br>\n The Masterclass addressed the increasing levels of adversity across the business environment and the necessary skills business leaders will need to be successful by 2020. The session highlighted the implications adversity will have on learning and development departments in organizations in Qatar, the impact on the education and business sectors, and the opportunities for growth as a result. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Leaders and managers in Qatar face increasing degrees of adversity in their business environment. Globally and regionally active competitors cause margins to erode and impede even the best plans from being implemented soundly and that will continue as business landscapes continue to evolve,&#x201D; said Dr Amann.<br>\n <br>\n HEC Paris is a proud partner of DLW, which runs from November 10-16, and is the flagship educational event of the World Innovation Summit on Education (WISE), aimed at celebrating and raising awareness of education and learning resources and initiatives in Doha. Held in collaboration with the Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy and other local partners, DLW featured a series of workshops, movie screenings, exhibitions, lectures, performances, tours, and hackathons. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/HEC%20Paris%20Doha%20Learning%20Week%20(DLW)%20-%20FINAL%20English.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8qf55","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/hec-paris-participates-in-doha-learning-week","currSlug":"/media-center/hec-paris-participates-in-doha-learning-week","title":"HEC Paris Participates in Doha Learning Week"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
