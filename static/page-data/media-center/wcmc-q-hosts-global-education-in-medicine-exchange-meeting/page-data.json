As we enter a new era of medical education that is far more global in outlook than ever before, GEMx provides a network through which our students can access truly valuable learning experiences in a variety of locations all over the world.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n The key function of GEMx is an innovative online system through which universities can publish details of the electives they offer. Students can use the system to apply for the electives, safe in the knowledge that the host school has signed up to the ECFMG charter, which guarantees established standards of student support and pre-agreed learning outcomes. <br>\n <br>\n Students who use GEMx can currently apply for electives in Australia, Bahrain, Colombia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Chile, Malaysia, India and Lebanon, among other countries. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/140126%20English%20WCMC-Q%20hosts%20Global%20Education%20in%20Medicine%20Exchange%20meeting.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf71","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcmc-q-hosts-global-education-in-medicine-exchange-meeting","currSlug":"/media-center/wcmc-q-hosts-global-education-in-medicine-exchange-meeting","title":"WCMC-Q Hosts Global Education In Medicine Exchange Meeting"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
