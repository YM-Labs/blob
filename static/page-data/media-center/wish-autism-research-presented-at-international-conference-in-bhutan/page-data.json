Health ministers from the South-East Asia region, international experts, individuals with autism and their caregivers, legislators, bureaucrats, and representatives from civil society attended the conference. The theme was: &#x2018;Effective and sustainable multi-sectoral programs for individuals, families and communities living with autism and neurodevelopmental disorders&#x2019;.<br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Qatar is quickly becoming a net-exporter of best practice in healthcare policy,&#x201D; said Egbert Schillings, CEO of WISH. &#x201C;Other countries are increasingly looking to Qatar to learn from its progressive health policies, with Autism being a perfect example. Just last week Qatar joined a small minority of nations globally to launch a comprehensive national strategy for autism spectrum disorder. We are delighted that Dr Waqar is carrying the message of broad support for people with autism to new audiences and that the WISH report helps inform the decisions of policymakers at the highest level worldwide.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The primary objective of the conference was to provide a platform for policymakers to engage with experts and stakeholders in sharing knowledge and best practices on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders. It also provided an opportunity to learn ways to align country specific strategies with sustainable development goals, as well as promote cooperation and partnerships between nations. <br>\n <br>\n To read the full WISH 2016 report: &#x2018;Autism: A Global Framework for Action&#x2019;, click here <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2fH1sbn\">http://bit.ly/2fH1sbn</a> <br>\n &#xA0;<br>\n For the full story, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_WISH_%20Autism%20Conference-Bhutan_PressRelease_En_2017420.pdf\">here</a></strong>.</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28qf6","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wish-autism-research-presented-at-international-conference-in-bhutan","currSlug":"/media-center/wish-autism-research-presented-at-international-conference-in-bhutan","title":"WISH Autism Research Presented at International Conference in Bhutan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
