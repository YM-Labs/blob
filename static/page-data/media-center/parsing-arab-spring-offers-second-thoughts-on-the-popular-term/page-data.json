It also explores how the spring descriptor came to be used by other regions going through political strife and why some circles have criticized the term. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;The linguistic and historical root of the word &#x2018;spring&#x2019; is very European,&#x201D; Abusharif explained. &#x201C;Using this terminology to describe an event in the Arab world for the benefit of a Western audience can be seen as wishful thinking for a democratization movement. Language matters; it frames events because it influences how people think and perhaps what they do. Sometimes the framing is accurate and sometimes it&#x2019;s questionable.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The paper, recently released in hard copy, is available free of charge through the NU-Q website at: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bit.ly/1ihudQz\">http://bit.ly/1ihudQz</a><br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/4_28_14_ParsingArabSpring_ENG.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12qf6","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/parsing-arab-spring-offers-second-thoughts-on-the-popular-term","currSlug":"/media-center/parsing-arab-spring-offers-second-thoughts-on-the-popular-term","title":"Parsing Arab Spring Offers Second Thoughts on the Popular Term"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
