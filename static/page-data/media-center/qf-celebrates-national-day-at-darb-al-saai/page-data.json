Through its immersive activities, such as the &#x2018;QF Globe&#x2019;, visitors were given the chance to learn about the history of QF, its achievements, success stories, international impact, and momentous milestones, across its four mission areas of Pre-University Education, Higher Education, Science and Research, and Community Development.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image2%20(16)-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image2 (16).JPG\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n Omer Aziz, who has visited the QF tent five times this year, said: &#x201C;During our first visit to the tent this year, we realized that once would not be enough to properly take part in all the activities. My children insisted that we visit the tent to go through each activity once again.&#x201D;<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image3%20(8)-17.jpg\" alt=\"Image3 (8).JPG\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n Another visitor, Awad Ahmed Alyafei, added: &#x201C;My children have been roaming the tent for half an hour now, and they refuse to leave. They are intrigued by the technology available here, such as the activities involving a microscope and the Northwestern University in Qatar studio. Qatar Foundation has provided wonderful health, education, and social experiences.&#x201D;<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image4%20(2)-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"638\"><br>\n Additional activities this year were presented by a range of QF members, including: Qatar Green Building Council, which provided a number of sustainability games and recycling activities; Qur&apos;anic Botanic Garden, which offered visitors the chance to plant seeds; Hamad Bin Khalifa University Press, where guests were able to make their own books; and Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar&#x2019;s healthy living initiative, &#x2018;Sahtak Awalan - Your Health First&#x2019;, which gave children the opportunity to make their own smoothies using blender bikes.<br>\n <br>\n Aisha Almarri said: &#x201C;My family and I really enjoyed the activities. My daughter rode a bicycle for several minutes and also learned about making healthy smoothies. She was so excited about it that she told us that she will give us ideas to make green smoothies once we get home. Some of the best things about this tent are the &#x2018;take-home&#x2019; activities, which are activities that continue even after we leave. For example, the children can pot their own plants and watch them grow during the next few months.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The QF tent at Darb Al-Saai will continue to run until Wednesday, December 20, and will be open from 8am-12pm and 4pm-10pm. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17qf27","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qf-celebrates-national-day-at-darb-al-saai","currSlug":"/media-center/qf-celebrates-national-day-at-darb-al-saai","title":"QF Celebrates National Day at Darb Al-Saai"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
