We look forward to hosting future cadres of interns from HBKU.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n HBKU&#x2019;s CSE offers multidisciplinary programs across a wide spectrum of fields and specialties, with the college&#x2019;s programs all focusing on areas identified as being vital for national, regional, and international prosperity.
