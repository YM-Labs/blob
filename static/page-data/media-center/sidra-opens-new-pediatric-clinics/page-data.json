We now have over 30 clinics, allied health and clinical services. This marks an important milestone as we prepare for our outpatient services to become fully operational by January 2017. We are also working towards the launch of day surgeries soon. Our day surgery clinic will conduct minor surgeries and procedures and pediatric patients will be discharged on the same day.
