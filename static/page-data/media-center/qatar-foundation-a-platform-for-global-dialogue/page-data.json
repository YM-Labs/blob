THIMUN Qatar will also partner with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime&#x2019;s Education for Justice (E4J) initiative, which will see many UNODC officials serve as sessional speakers at the event. <br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_QF_DohaForum_Feature_EN.pdf\">here</a>&#xA0;</div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf45","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-a-platform-for-global-dialogue","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-a-platform-for-global-dialogue","title":"Qatar Foundation: A Platform for Global Dialogue"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
