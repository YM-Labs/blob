It continues to partner with international construction businesses on some of the most innovative construction projects in the region. </p>\n<p>Mike Mitchell, General Counsel for Qatar Foundation, said:\n“Qatar Foundation is pleased that the court has confirmed our approach to this arbitration. We have always maintained that the JV’s challenge represented a futile last-ditch effort to evade accountability for their significant delays and defaults in delivering the Sidra project.  We now look forward to concluding the arbitration and obtaining an appropriate monetary award.” </p>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"pEIpMVdxHA7YmJ3h8PwDH","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-foundation-wins-a-major-victory-against-ohl-and-contrack-in-gbp1-9bn","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-foundation-wins-a-major-victory-against-ohl-and-contrack-in-gbp1-9bn","title":"Qatar Foundation wins a major victory against OHL and Contrack in £1.9bn hospital dispute"}}}
