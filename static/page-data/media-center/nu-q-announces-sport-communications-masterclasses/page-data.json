The program &#x2013; The Changing Business of Sport and Sport Communications &#x2013; will serve as a link for professionals who want to begin or enhance a career in sport communication and will focus on media, marketing, and law. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/NGUT-1385-NWQ-0623%5B14%5D-17.jpg\" alt=\"NGUT-1385-NWQ-0623[14].jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n All of the masterclasses will be held at NU-Q&#x2019;s new building in Education City. The first, scheduled for February 10th is &#x201C;Media Old and New, and the Transformation of World Sport&#x201D;; the second, &#x201C;Sport Law and Governance &#x2013; The Rules that Regulate Sport Organizations&#x201D; will be held on February 17th; and the third, &#x201C;Using Sport Marketing to Influence the Growth of Business and Sport,&#x201D; on February 24th. <br>\n <br>\n The first seminar, taught by NU-Q Professor Craig LaMay, an expert in sports journalism, will examine what industry scholars refer to as &#x201C;mediasport,&#x201D; its current and future prospects, with special attention to the sports media landscape of Qatar and the Middle East. This will also include innovations in virtual and augmented reality, over-the-top sports content, e-sports, athlete-created media, fantasy sports, and big data. <br>\n <br>\n The second seminar on sports governance and media law will be taught by Fordham University Professor Mark Conrad, author of The Business of Sports, and will discuss, compare, and analyze many of the key legal concepts that govern international sports, an industry that until recently has largely governed itself, with minimal involvement of national authorities anywhere. Conrad is the president of the Alliance for Sport Business, 2016-18; and past president, Sport and Recreation Law Association, 2014-2015.<br>\n <br>\n The last seminar, taught by Northwestern University Professor Candy Lee, will provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and opportunities in sports marketing, which runs the spectrum from crisis communication on player behavior to ticket-pricing strategies for teams having a bad season. Lee was Teacher of the Year in 2012 for Integrated Marketing Communications at the Medill School at Northwestern and previously served as vice president of marketing at The Washington Post. The course will also consider traditional areas of marketing through the lens of sports and entertainment, and will include video interviews, examples, case studies, and discussion activities.<br>\n <br>\n February&#x2019;s masterclasses will be offered to individuals with undergraduate degrees and a minimum of one to two years of professional experience. A certificate in Sport Communication will be awarded for completion of all three masterclasses.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/English%20Press%20Release%20Sports%20Media%20Program%202.pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11qf12","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/nu-q-announces-sport-communications-masterclasses","currSlug":"/media-center/nu-q-announces-sport-communications-masterclasses","title":"NU-Q Announces Sport Communications Masterclasses"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
