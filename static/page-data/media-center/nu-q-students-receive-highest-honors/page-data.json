The honors, which use Latin names &#x2013; magna, summa, and cum laude &#x2013; are conferred to students based on their academic performance over their entire educational experience as undergraduates. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/NUQ%20Commencement17-24.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"300\" width=\"560\"><br>\n &#x201C;These honors reflect academic excellence across all their coursework, including liberal arts instructing, as well as professional endeavors in their majors,&#x201D; said Everette E.
