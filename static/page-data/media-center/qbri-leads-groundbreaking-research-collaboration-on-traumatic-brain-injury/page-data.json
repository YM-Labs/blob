The research project is made possible through a grant from the National Priorities Research Program of the Qatar National Research Fund.<br>\n <br>\n The Lead Principal Investigator on the project is Dr. Erwin Blezer, a scholar of immunology, neuroscience and physiology at the UMC Utrecht and the co-Lead Principal Investigator is Dr. Mohamed Ali from QBRI. <br>\n <br>\n More than 10 million people worldwide suffer from traumatic brain injury and the condition is now considered the leading cause of death and disability among people under the age of 45.In Qatar, the number of individuals affected by traumatic brain injury is nearly twice as high as in Europe; however with few therapeutic interventions available to protect the brain or facilitate recovery, inquiry into this issue is critical. <br>\n <br>\n The research project will use animal models of TBI and advanced imaging techniques to elucidate small-scale underlying changes at the organ, tissue and cellular levels. The work will be mainly conducted in the Netherlands and Qatar. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160221_QBRI%20Traumatic%20Brain%20Injury%20Grant_English.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here.</strong></a><br>\n &#xA0;</div></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf48","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qbri-leads-groundbreaking-research-collaboration-on-traumatic-brain-injury","currSlug":"/media-center/qbri-leads-groundbreaking-research-collaboration-on-traumatic-brain-injury","title":"QBRI Leads Groundbreaking Research Collaboration on Traumatic Brain Injury"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
