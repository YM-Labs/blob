This allows instructors to use class time to utilize that knowledge as a basis for a variety of enriched learning activities such as collaborative discussions, practical exercises and, crucially for medical students, simulated learning sessions that mimic real-world interactions with patients.<br>\n <br>\n More than 60 educators working in the health professions field attended the &#x2018;Digital Education Strategies for Implementing the Flipped Classroom&#x2019; conference, which was delivered by Dr. Traci Wolbrink and Dr. Dennis Daniel, both of Boston Children&#x2019;s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo2%20(5)-17.jpg\" alt=\"Photo2 (5).jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"640\"><br>\n Attendees took part in 12 interactive learning sessions over the two days, covering topics such as the evolution of medical education in the digital context, characteristics of millennial learners, adult learning theory, definitions of the flipped classroom, audience response systems and practical advice on how to create effective and compelling video and audio recordings for learners. <br>\n <br>\n The event was coordinated by WCM-Q&#x2019;s Division of Continuing Professional Development as part of the college&#x2019;s Educators Across the Healthcare Spectrum series, which promotes excellence and innovation in the field of health professions education. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Photo3%20(4)-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"426\" width=\"639\"><br>\n The event was accredited locally by the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners-Accreditation Department (QCHP-AD) and internationally by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME).<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <strong><a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/171225-20English-20WCM-Q-20explores-20the-20-Flipped-20Classroom--20model-20transforming....pdf\">here</a></strong>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25qf82","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-explores-flipped-classroom-model-transforming-medical-education","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-explores-flipped-classroom-model-transforming-medical-education","title":"WCM-Q Explores ‘Flipped Classroom’ Model Transforming Medical Education"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
