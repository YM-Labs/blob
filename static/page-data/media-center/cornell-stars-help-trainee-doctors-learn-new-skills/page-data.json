We show the students how to perform a basic physical examination and the creative ways that pediatricians use to soothe the child, keep them calm and get them to comply; for example, we might let them listen to their heartbeat with the stethoscope.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n She said that the nature of the examination is opportunistic and that with an adult, physicians would be methodical and go from head to toe, but with children they have to take opportunities when they present themselves. Usually a doctor will start at the heart and lungs of young child and go on to the abdomen, before examining the ears and finally the nose and throat so as to minimize any distress.<br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/WCM4-24.jpg\" alt=\"WCM4.JPG\" width=\"560\" height=\"300\"><br>\n Dr. Mai Mahmoud, assistant professor of medicine and director of the Introductory Clerkship Course, added: &#x201C;The Cornell Stars program is incredibly important to the development and education of our students as fully-rounded doctors I would like to thank all of the parents and children who took part for their valuable support, as well as our colleagues for sharing their time and experience: Dr. Najla Sharahil of Hamad Hospital, Dr. Wail Ali Seleem and Dr. Abdussalam Shah of Al Wakra Hospital, Dr. Sharda Udassi and Dr. Amin Salem from Sidra Medical and Research Center, and Dr. Mohamud Verjee, of WCM-Q. <br>\n <br>\n In all, 45 medical students took part in the Cornell Stars event and it was the first time they had been presented with children as &#x2018;patients&#x2019;.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n To read more please click&#xA0; <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/170704%20English%20Cornell%20Stars%20help%20trainee%20doctors%20learn%20new%20skills.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3qf33","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/cornell-stars-help-trainee-doctors-learn-new-skills","currSlug":"/media-center/cornell-stars-help-trainee-doctors-learn-new-skills","title":"Cornell Stars Help Trainee Doctors Learn New Skills"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
