The survey will be open for four weeks in order to gather as much information as possible. <br>\n <br>\n QGBC is keen to better understand personal resource consumption in order to find solutions that will ease the country&#x2019;s energy demands. <br>\n <br>\n Available to read in both Arabic and English, the simple, five-minute e-survey poses questions about electricity consumption through food preparation, TV watching and use of other domestic appliances. <br>\n <br>\n Anyone interested in taking part in QGBC&#x2019;s nation-wide study can complete the &#x2018;How Green Is Your Home?&#x2019; e-survey by visiting: <a href=\"http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/qgbcsurvey\" target=\"_blank\">www.surveymonkey.com/s/qgbcsurvey</a>. <br>\n <br>\n All entrants who leave a contact address will automatically be entered into a prize draw with the opportunity to win a mini-iPad and other spot prizes. <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/21-9-2014%20QGBC%20E-survey_En.pdf\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14qf75","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qatar-green-building-council-launches-how-green-is-your-home-e-survey","currSlug":"/media-center/qatar-green-building-council-launches-how-green-is-your-home-e-survey","title":"Qatar Green Building Council Launches ‘How Green Is Your Home?’ E-Survey"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
