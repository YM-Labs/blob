With one in 10 women living with diabetes worldwide, the disease has become the ninth leading cause of death among women, and a health issue of global significance. <br>\n <img src=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Image2(5)-17.jpg\" alt=\"null\" height=\"424\" width=\"640\"><br>\n QDA is at the forefront of research and awareness in the fight against the disease, and provides innovative patient care and diabetes education to various segments of society. It is also an active member of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the global advocate for the prevention and cure of diabetes, comprising 230 associations from 170 countries.<br>\n <br>\n In collaboration with the Landmark Group, QDA will hold a number of activities to mark WDD this year, providing people with greater awareness of the disease. Some of the events taking place include a symposium for doctors, a panel discussion about diabetes with physicians from police and army clinics, and a walkathon at QF&#x2019;s Oxygen Park in Education City on November 17. <br>\n <br>\n Additionally, QDA recently collaborated with Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, a partner university of QF, on two different research methods regarding the complications involved with diabetes in women. The research involved minimizing the risk factors for diabetes in women after pregnancy. <br>\n <br>\n In addition to organizing WDD activities each year, QDA holds a number of community outreach programs throughout the year, including diabetes awareness programs at schools and workplaces, symposiums, and diabetes prevention camps. For example, QDA&#x2019;s Al-Bawasil camp for children regularly hosts around 60 children from Qatar and the MENA region to teach them about diabetes and healthy living. QDA also collaborates with healthcare professionals around the country to share knowledge, and stay up-to-date with current research. <br>\n <br>\n QDA was established in 1995, and is a leading authority on diabetes education and awareness. QDA has been an active member of IDF since 1997, and is one of the 24 diabetes organizations from 19 countries and territories that represent IDF&#x2019;s Middle East and North Africa region.<br>\n <br>\n To read more, please click <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/CD_EC_QF_WorldDiabetesDay_Feature_EN_20171113(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17qf12","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qf-advocates-for-womens-health-in-fight-against-diabetes","currSlug":"/media-center/qf-advocates-for-womens-health-in-fight-against-diabetes","title":"QF Advocates for Women’s Health in Fight against Diabetes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
