Commenting on this multi-sectoral approach to support education, Her Highness said: &#x201C;By bringing the expertise of different partners, we are changing the ecosystem around education and making it sustainable. For instance, in Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya, we are working with organizations that will contribute to the health, employment and energy issues of the camp.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Launched in 2012 with the aim of significantly reducing the estimated 57 million children worldwide who are denied their fundamental right to education, EAC projects reach countries that account for nearly 70 percent of all out of school children. Its focus is replicating and scaling-up successful quality programs, promoting innovative approaches and encouraging collaboration, to ensure the best outcomes for children and their communities.<br>\n <br>\n The financing gap for education in low-income countries amounts to $26 billion per year according to 2011 OECD figures. To address this, EAA is developing a global resource mobilization model.<br>\n <br>\n Commenting on the need for increased resources for education, Her Highness said: &#x201C;We need to tap into new sources of funding, from philanthropists to governments. We need all sectors to understand the importance of education, not only as a human right, but as an economic imperative. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;One additional year of schooling increases a child&#x2019;s potential future earnings by up to 10 percent. So investing in education is an investment in the greatest resources &#x2013; human resources.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Filippo Grandi of UNRWA announced the signing of an agreement with Education Above All to provide emergency education to 67,000 Palestinian refugee children affected by the conflict in Syria.Hans-J&#xFC;rgen Beerfeltz, representing Germany&#x2019;s donor agency, also announced a strategic partnership with EAA.<br>\n <br>\n To read the full article on the WISE website, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.media.wise-qatar.org/her-highness-sheikha-moza-bint-nasser-calls-for-collaboration-and-new-funding-to-accelerate-access-to-education/\"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8qf93","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/her-highness-sheikha-moza-bint-nasser-calls-for-collaboration-and-new-funding-to-accelerate-access-to-education","currSlug":"/media-center/her-highness-sheikha-moza-bint-nasser-calls-for-collaboration-and-new-funding-to-accelerate-access-to-education","title":"Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser Calls for Collaboration and New Funding to Accelerate Access to Education"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
