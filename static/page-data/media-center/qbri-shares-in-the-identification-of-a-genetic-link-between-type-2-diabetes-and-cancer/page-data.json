Notably, individuals with CME had at least a 10 times higher risk of developing hematologic cancer. <br>\n <br>\n <a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/Diabetes%20and%20Cancer%20Press%20Release_Eng_final.pdf\"> For the full story, please click here.</a><br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16qf51","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/qbri-shares-in-the-identification-of-a-genetic-link-between-type-2-diabetes-and-cancer","currSlug":"/media-center/qbri-shares-in-the-identification-of-a-genetic-link-between-type-2-diabetes-and-cancer","title":"QBRI Shares In The Identification Of A Genetic Link Between Type 2 Diabetes And Cancer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
