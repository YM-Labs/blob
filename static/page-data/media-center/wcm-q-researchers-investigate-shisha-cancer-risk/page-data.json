I cannot emphasize enough that this is not true. The water only cools the smoke, it does not filter out the toxins.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr Sohaila Cheema, Director of Global and Public Health at WCM-Q, said: &#x201C;Water-pipe smoking is a very social act, and in the Middle East it is more socially acceptable for women than smoking cigarettes. This means that patterns of use are quite different from cigarette smoking so it is vital that we study water-pipe use separately to understand the risks more clearly.&#x201D;<br>\n The meta-analysis of the 28 studies revealed data that points to a strong association between water-pipe smoking and cancers of the head and neck, esophagus and lung. The study, entitled &#x2018;Cancer risk in water-pipe smokers: a meta-analysis&#x2019; has now been published in the International Journal of Public Health. <br>\n <br>\n Dr Cheema added: &#x201C;Our analysis of the existing studies points to a clear association between water-pipe smoking and several forms of cancer, and people need to be aware of this so that they can make informed choices about whether they smoke or not. We also determined that the number of high-quality studies into the effects of water-pipe smoking is very low, so there is a great need for more investigation in this area, especially as shisha is so popular nowadays.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Dr Mamtani said: &#x201C;Governments around the world have taken steps to reduce cigarette smoking in their populations through measures such as public health campaigns, tax policy, creating smoke-free areas and passing laws about what can be displayed on packaging. Until now, water-pipe smoking has managed to escape many of these measures. <br>\n &#x201C;It is time for more studies about water-pipe smoking, more public awareness of the risks, and we can also explore the opportunities for public policy on this issue to protect public health.&#x201D; <br>\n <br>\n <br>\n For the full story, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/160922%20English%20WCM-Q%20researchers%20investigate%20shisha%20cancer%20risk.pdf\"><strong>click here </strong></a><br>\n <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26qf29","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/wcm-q-researchers-investigate-shisha-cancer-risk","currSlug":"/media-center/wcm-q-researchers-investigate-shisha-cancer-risk","title":"WCM-Q researchers investigate shisha cancer risk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
