It aims not only to equip high school students with practical skills, but also to give them a glimpse of life as biomedical researchers, fueling their passion for science and scholarship. Many students who complete the program go on to apply to study medicine at WCM-Q. <br>\n <br>\n High school student Mooza Al-Hail, 16, attends Al Maha Academy for Girls, and said: &#x201C;I have been able to spend a lot of time in the lab actually learning real skills and seeing how research is done, which has been really exciting. <br>\n <br>\n &#x201C;Biology is my favorite subject at school and I would love to study medicine at WCM-Q in the future. I have also learned about perseverance because when you are doing any project you find lots of obstacles. I learned that if you work hard and think critically, you can find a way through and succeed.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n Christy Poppe, Senior Research Training Specialist at WCM-Q, said: &#x201C;Bringing enthusiastic young Qatari high school students to WCM-Q to gain research experience not only helps them plot successful careers, but also enhances Qatar&#x2019;s ability to conduct world-class biomedical research, helping to build upon the country&#x2019;s growing status as a regional research hub.&#x201D;<br>\n <br>\n The Research Internship for National High School Students program targets Qatari nationals who are aged 16 and above. The program also counts towards students&#x2019; voluntary community service hours. Students who complete the course can log between 50-100 hours of service, depending on whether they take the two-week or four-week option.<br>\n <br>\n For more information about WCM-Q internships and training programs, visit: <br>\n https://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/research/research-training-programs/overview.<br>\n &#xA0;<br>\n To read more, please click&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qfwebsiteold.azureedge.net/$web/app/media/180828%20English%20Summer%20of%20research%20at%20WCM-Q%20for%20Qatari%20high%20school%20studen....pdf\">here</a><br type=\"_moz\"></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22qf54","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/summer-of-research-at-wcm-q-for-qatari-students","currSlug":"/media-center/summer-of-research-at-wcm-q-for-qatari-students","title":"Summer of Research at WCM-Q for Qatari Students"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
