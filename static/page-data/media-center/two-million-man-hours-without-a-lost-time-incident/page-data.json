Initially the plant will produce 8,000 metric tons of polysilicon per year (MTPY) and it is designed to expand as demand grows. Polysilicon is the essential building block of the world&#x2019;s most efficient solar energy technologies. It harnesses solar power by being converted into ingots, wafers, cells and the solar panels that produce solar energy.<br>\n <br>\n Built on 1.2 million square meters of land, the plant can expand polysilicon capacity to 45,000 MTPY and has been designed to seamlessly incorporate ingots, wafers, cell and module manufacturing facilities.<br>\n <br>\n The company is a joint venture between Qatar Foundation SolarWorld AG and the Qatar Development Bank.<br>\n <br>\n In October 2012, Qatar announced that it will generate 1.8 Gigawatts of solar power by 2014 as part of the vision to generate 20 percent of the country&#x2019;s total energy requirements through solar power. <br></div>"}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24qf31","languageCode":"en-US","alternateLanguage":"/ar/media-center/two-million-man-hours-without-a-lost-time-incident","currSlug":"/media-center/two-million-man-hours-without-a-lost-time-incident","title":"Two Million Man Hours Without A Lost Time Incident"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2339101861","2774812936","3702695878"]}
